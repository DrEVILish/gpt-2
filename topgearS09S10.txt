Tonight, Jaguar supercharged XKR versus its twin sister.
Why do roadworks take so long? Come on! Put it back into it, you, man.
And Jamie Oliver prepares a delicious lap in our reasonably-priced car.
Hello, hello and yes! We'll also be showing you We'll also be showing you a very small man having a very big car accident.
But, even we with our limited knowledge of television realize that you don't do that now, you have to do that later on in the show, otherwise everyone would just watch it now and turn over to watch the final of Big Brother.
So what we're actually doing about that is saving you from yourselves, really.
Yeah, we are.
That's one problem solved.
But we do have another one of course, because all the time that we've been off air, people have been coming up to me and Jeremy, and they've been saying will Top Gear go back to the way it was? Is it still just gonna be three normal blokes cocking about and arguing? I mean it's actually a problem really, because obviously one of us blokes has now become Princess Diana.
It's tricky.
No, he really has.
However, Princess Diana himself has said quite explicitly that he just wants to come back onto a show that is the way it was back in the summer.
Exactly.
He said please don't make any changes, please.
Yeah, he actually said explicitly "for pete's sake, don't make a big fuss.
" Absolutely.
So it gives me really great pleasure 'cause I didn't think I'd ever be saying this at one point.
Ladies and gentlemen, would you please welcome Richard Hammond! Oh, well, this is a pretty awkward.
Thank you, I said no fuss, no fu Oh, sorry gals, sorry, sorry, sorry gals, sorry I said no fuss.
Mate! Hammond! - Oh man! - I'll be great to have you back! James May! Oh, that's embarrassing, really is embarrassing.
That's em, that whole stairs thing, That was the most embarrassing thing I've ever had to do.
Well I wouldn't say that to any of the people who just had to jump off a Boeing 737, / We were gonna get some like / ones, do you know the big ones? Do you know how much they were to gonna be to build? Oh, fair enough.
I mean we like it, OK? We are glad you're back.
But 300 quid to build a gate? So no, the aeroplane stair.
I wish you hadn't bothered, thank you.
Anyway, listen.
This is the big question, I guess, everybody wants to know.
Here ready? Are you now a mental? No.
I'm not.
I'm fixed.
I'm completely fixed and normal and healed.
Thank you.
What are you doing? Well you know it's a, it's a tissue for if you start dribbling.
That's all I've had for four months.
What? Tissues? No, people hanging around just watching, waiting for my eyes to point in different directions and me to go bonkers.
I'm fixed.
I'm normal.
Are you the same person that you were before? Yeah, I mean the doctors were worried because it's brain damage, about, you know, personality change or whatever But, no, the only difference really between me now and me before the crash, is I like celery now and I didn't.
So you're still shouty, you're still fighty? Yes.
And if I take you to the pub are you still gonna want to punch me in the face after 15 minutes? Yes, though that's to be honest, more your personality than mine.
- You see, I always want to punch him in the face after 15 minutes - Yeah, that's perfectly normal.
sometimes less OK, look, the most important thing I think really is to make sure this never happens again, the crash.
'cause I mean that you're like the cat from "Shrek II" here.
You have used up 8 of your 9 lives really.
So I've decided that in future, all the very fast cars, the Lambos, the Astons, the Ferraris, I'll look after them, I'll You'll drive them? Yeah, I'll drive them.
No personality change for you either.
Then it's business as usual.
Absolutely, I'm still the same kind thoughtful soul that I always was.
That's quite moving.
- OK, brilliant.
- Thank you.
Thank you for that and thank you as well for the embarrassing stairs thing, that's great.
There is one more thank you please if you don't mind, difference here is perhaps, I mean this one.
I'd like to say thank you to all of the nurses, and the doctors and all the staff in Leeds and in Bristol where I was when I was being stuck back together, and the people, Yorkshire air ambulance, who got me there in time, and particularly, and particularly right now, to everybody who wrote in.
Some of the people here maybe, and you perhaps that wrote in just to wish me the best.
It really meant a lot and helped and thank you for that.
Hey, bravo! The stairs are nice You're eyebrows aren't burnt and what? You eyebrows Oh they are fixed they can't be broken.
Shall we resume normal service? Absolutely, err, good idea, because I've got a bit of bean in my bonnet.
- See what I mean? - Yeah.
Listen, the thing is, roadworks.
For the last year or so, I have been virtually cut off from London because they've been digging up the Oxford ring road, OK? At one point, they had it down to a single lane, and you had to go down that, being escorted by a van with yellow flashing lights on the roof at 10 mph.
It'd be better off and quicker on a horse.
Then they said it was something you going this slowly to protect the work force but there wasn't a work force there.
They were never doing anything 'cause they were in a hut having a health and safty lecture.
He is absolutely right.
These days with roadworks, you never get that sense that they are getting on with it, doing it quickly and efficiently for the benefit of those people who might be inconvenienced.
Who pay their wages exactly.
I mean it's really simple.
Close the road, slap some new tarmac on it, tell the health and safety people to get stuffed and get the damn thing open as quickly as possible.
I mean how hard can it be? Oh, how I've missed the pang of dread I feel whenever you mentioned the words how hard can it be? Well, we are just about to find out.
This is the critically important D5481 just outside the village of Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire.
The surface looks like a lunar teenager's face.
And the council said repairing the 1.
5 miles stretch would mean closing it completely for one working week.
A massive inconvenience for the people of Bidford.
But we've taken the job over and by being efficient, and hard working and organized, we're gonna try and get the job done in 24 hours.
Are we ready? Oh yeah.
Let's go! Immediately though, there was a problem.
I just wanna go through the barriers, the safety aspects before we start work.
First of which is the protective equipment you're gonna have to use.
You all must have your boots, your trousers, jackets and your hat on.
We don't have time for this.
/ we're going backwards as well forwards So anyone walking beyond the plant must have a chaperone with them, Just beware the / tows please, don't want any broken ankles or sprained ankles telling you which piece of PPE(Personal Protective Equipment) you must wear Let's just get out of the way.
everybody general PPE, any questions? Can we start now? not until you're suited and booted, I'm afraid well, we're dressed Can't see my genitals.
The safety lecture droned on for so long that we really had to get cracking, if we were to begin as planned on the dot of 9 a.
m.
Now it's a 1.
5 miles stretch.
And we're gonna dig it up, repave it, roll it, paint new white lines, the lot.
Yeah, and because the road is actually gonna be closed, we have to have a diversion set up.
And that's what James is doing right now.
Right, this is really very simple.
Here is our road, here, and obviously that's closed 'cause that's where we're working on.
So anybody wanted to go down there to Ardens Grafton would have to go round the block.
So I'm gonna put a sign up that takes them towards Stratford down there, and then somewhere I'll take them back around back around there and they'll be back around at Ardens.
at the other end of this road.
Easy.
Normally for a job like this, they'd use 14 men.
We were using 32.
And to pat them up, I prepared a stowing motivational speech.
the Parthenon, the pyramids, the Great Wall of China, Each a shiningeach a shining beacon of ambition.
And today gentlemen, the D5481 will join that list.
We shall build this road in a day! Our resurfacing work will last for 1,000 years! Sadly, Jeremy's speech went on a bit.
But nevertheless, on the dot of 9:07, we began.
The first job was to rip up the old surface and for that, we needed a plainer/.
To operate it safely, you suppose to use three men but we put two on other jobs and decided to go it alone.
You're gonna drive that.
Yes.
Teeth dig up the road, rubble goes up there and into the truck.
Exactly right.
Which Well, you can drive it.
James' diversion meanwhile, hadn't got off to a good start.
Hey? Oh, cock.
Yeah, all right.
Well, I finally up/ the cutters.
all the revs Here we go, hand brake, off.
Engine.
OK, let's go, yeah.
Jeremy, catch up, man, what are you doing.
Just look behind you and see if it's going in the bloody lorry.
Ignore the sign.
Ignore the sign, it's wrong.
James was being rubbish, but then we were hardly employees of the month either.
/ look, stop putting me off You've missed the truck.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
And then things got worse.
Jeremy, there is a slight problem.
What? I've sort of set off with a bit of angle, and I'm on the wrong bit of road.
- This is Bidford, isn't it? - Yeah.
If you wanted to get back to there, but without using that road, which is the best way to go? Err, up to the island, - Up there? - Yeah.
third turn in after the island.
What's happened is it goes in the bit of a straight line, Yeah.
and then when you tried to turn it back in, it stalled.
So I'm trying to get it back to the Give it more power.
There is a Clarkson answer to a problem Just more power.
So far, in forty minutes, we've done - 20 yards? - 20 yards.
And you think this is helping? Right, left, industrial estate I'm quite pleased with the way this is going now.
You've just hit me again! I feel as though we are working as a team well.
Jeremy, we've got to stop.
What for? Because the truck is full and overflowing and it might not be able to tip it out which means we'll have to do it with shovels, you pillock.
To save time, I simply parked the lorry at the side of the road and emptied it there.
Empty! This didn't seem to go down well with my colleagues.
That's a gate.
Whose gate? I Does it matter? It's a gate, it's somebody's gate.
and you put several tons of road in it.
And I won't I can't do a 3 point turn now either, can I? No, you can't.
That's the only turning place.
You're on your own, man.
I'm sorry.
Can you get a digger? No! So it goes left, right, left, industrial estate, right.
Yeah, pass the industrial estate -There's only a mini round about.
- /.
Turn right up Georges Elm Lane.
Georges Elm Lane, which is the first on the right.
Pass industrial estate.
At this stage, things were going quite badly.
So we handed the lorry and the plainer over to the professionals.
Richard was then given the simple job of tidying up, and I went back to making motivational speeches.
This is not the end, this is not the beginning, this is not the beginning of the end, it's not even With the men motivated nicely, we soon have the old surface cleared and then started to lay the /pitchinging which glues the new tarmac in place.
Some people then began to ask if they could have a break.
But of course the answer was no.
This is how we're managing to speed things up.
Lunch on this job is what you can find in the hedge.
Dickensian work practices alone though, would not get this job done in a day.
You also need to throw resources at it.
something councils seem unwilling to do.
I really wanna get these math worked out because the way we're doing this, throwing men and machines at it and doing it in a day is 7,000 pounds more expansive than having 8-hour days, and taking a week.
But I reckon, you only need inconvenience 500 people for an hour a day, for you to be better off doing it our way.
At 1 o'clock, James finally finished his diversion giving locals lots of alternatives and returned to find me having a power nap.
Work sets you free.
Refreshed, I came up with yet more ways to speed things up.
You know when the trucks back up, Yeah.
There's a man walking behind them.
The banksman, yeah.
But all trucks've got to have cameras on them as well.
They do as well.
So why do you need a man and a camera? That man could be better employed making roadworks.
It's double protection, isn't it? - If somebody - It's not.
It's just what? Well, did you hear though, in fairness, one bloke recently got run over by that plaining machine.
How interest am I in that? They only found his hand.
Don't care.
By 2:30, the road had been sprayed with / glue and was ready to receive the new layer of tarmac.
This is the most critical part of our whole operation.
Normally, they would reckon on laying between 250 and 270 tons of tarmac in a day.
Now we're gonna try and lay, how much is it? Eleven hundred tons.
One thousand and one hundred tons in a day.
That's why we've got Hammond up at tarmac's kind of quarry plant thing, up near/ to make sure the supplies keep coming.
The modern quarry is full of heavy part, but actually it is all controlled by a computer.
Oh, mother of.
We've got / mixer and a pump OK, stay calm.
I can do e-mails, I can do this lot, em.
Plainly he mastered it, because soon the trucks began to arrive.
But unfortunately, the paving machine that lays the tarmac was being driven by the slowest person in the world.
Wait, James.
What? If a job is worth doing, it's worth doing quickly.
No, well.
Quickly.
Well.
Quickly.
Well.
Quickly.
Well.
Still, overall, things were moving along nicely.
Men of the D5481 things are looking good, I'm seeing machines moving about now.
Yeah, yes.
Err, now we're gonna pick up that later on when obviously everything starts to go wrong.
Um now though, now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
Now, since our guest tonight first came on the show, he launched a campaign to improve school dinners and has become really a saint he now wields more political power than a president, he glides through Hollywood parties like a film star, interestingly though, he still talks like he's eating a pillow.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Jamie Oliver.
Hello there.
Hello.
Have a seat, it's nice of you to come back.
thank you very much.
very good.
this uhthis school dinner thing really has propelled you along.
you were just like "another chef", and now you're national hero, a God, I tell you.
I take offence to that.
I was never just another chef, was I, guys? there is a I mean you could was I, guys? anyway Gordon, um it didn't go down well in Rotherham? Rotherham? oh with those old birds putting the old err the / through the railings Yeah, they were feeding their what were they feeding their kids with? BigMacs? That's right, coz we they they changed the regulations came in, they changed all the junk, err and basically some moms started selling the junk food through the railings but I was in Australia when I saw it, it was on BBC world news, and I just woke up literately, and all I can see is like hundreds of hands coming through bars, and these oldbig old scrubbers poking stuff through there, taking all their money and um I used to work in Rotherhamplease thing is, IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½m abso are youyou're absolutely convinced this is for real, this "we've all got to eat more healthily", I just think getting fat is actually evolution, I am evolving into a more civilized being by being fatter.
yes.
which actually brings me onto an important point, dieting yes.
- I've got a diet, impossible.
- OK.
well what are you eating for crying Food, well now I mean when I diet, I eat carrots and diet coke.
right and that's it.
and it works, I lose weight, but I faint all the time.
you faint all the time? I do faint coz the problem I got Jamie, genuinely, I walk into a supermarket yes? and you look at food and think: what's fattening and what isn't Uh, well I think you know you can try and simplify it, uh for instance, if you cook, um you know Jeremy, that's a lot healthier than buying sort of pre-packed food also if you like chili, chili speeds up your metabolism by 25%, uh and also you can get high on it, which is great, and it's legal, go raving, nice.
IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½m all over chili, mate.
So if I put chili in my diet coke? I grew a load of chili this year, and I grew the hottest in the world and IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½m telling ya, hoho.
coz there is another thing, you do grow quite a lot of your organic - yeah, the last 3 years, yeah.
- what? - about 5% of the stuff to 15 - it's impossible it's not impossible yes it is.
Lilisten, if I, IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ve never grown anything until 3 years ago, like likeituh, the first year, I didn't know what I was doing, just by putting seeds in mud, you'd amazed, 80% of the stuff grows into something, you have to be a complete idiot to not grow anything I planted a field of barley last year Barley? Barley What are you planting barley for? - If you really want to know, it was to attract a certain type of bird, - grow potatoes and beans which I like, IIÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½m a RSPB member, don't mention that to please don't say that.
- and I want to a bit - are you a twitcher? shhh, please, the thing is, I grew this but I thought: I won't put any fertilizer on it coz that'll poison the birds, it grew to this long and was bright grey, it's costed me a fortune and I just think fertilizer works, fertilizer is good - no no - it is.
Don't spray the ground Why? Coz it just wrecks all the microbes and their organisms and the stuff that goes on on and a lot of it are versions of poisons, you just don't know what you Yes, but who knows? there was something I bought the other day, it was organic, do you know what it had been fertilized with? Crap - yes, human excrement from Mexicans - Not human, it's illegal - it is, Mexicans can crap on your food, and then they - no.
It's organic, - they're all out in the fields, - no.
With some subras and ponchos on, defecating on your bananas Can I just say, if your introduction into growing stuff and all the wonderful things that makes you feel good about, if your introduction is barley, no wonder you're miserable.
it is complicated though, eating well is complicated.
I mean my donkey died the other day, do I eat it? Have you ever eaten a donkey? It was Jeffery, man.
you can't - I know you could make sausage - a little bit of rosemary, a bit of time, A bit of garlic, tenderize it, you know, 170 for about 6 hours, it will be lovely.
especially the tail.
can we talk about cars? yes, let's talk about cars.
You came down here obviously primarily, I know I wanted to beat Gordon, let's be honest about it, make Coz Gordon is at the top And he got a really good speed as well, which was 46.
3, um last time I came on the show, it was just after Gordon, and we both got 1:50 in the old moaner in the old car, exactly.
And I kinda maintain pride by at least joining him, I was so geared up this week You were, he actually said, can I come down early to practice coz I really wanna beat Gordon.
Yeah.
And this was the scene that greeted him when he got here, early.
There it is, there are the cars, ready for you to go out in them.
We did wait for the snow to fall, and you went out, ok? who'd like to see well I think we just got one bit of practice here, would you like to see that? [crowd.]
Yeah.
Let's play the tape of Jamie having a bit of bash here, oh coming upwhere are we? bound to be the second to last corner, catches everybody out and yes it is, nice line through oh no, that's wrong oh no no no oh Bring out the new car.
And that was , that was the end of that car then yeah, I, I actually I it was, I think totaled it I think the wheel, broken radiator and suspension, so No worries - we'll have it fixed for next week, - sorry.
after that, ok? after that, you were ready to do your lap yes ok? Gordon to beat, - which is what?1:46 - I never, I just doubt it so much Who'd like to see his lap? [crowd.]
yes Here we go, let's have a look.
Well, it looks like you've been off in this one as well yes, I had here we go, looking keen, how is the old car? compared to the old old one? it's a little bit faster on the faster bits - it is.
- but it's still a hair dryer that's a nice line through that thank you Jeremy.
I am very brilliant Oh youthough you say so yourself, around Chicago, here we go again, looking good this power cuts out, this is a piece of crap, this car.
then you'll find that's called a rev-limiter, most cars have it, - oh, a bit of understeer there - Look at that lean - you are towing around most of / underneath there - That's so tight though, isn't it? That was actually that was very good, that was well rescued from the last understeer, did you lift here? You do Do look like special needs sometimes Jamie, there, there we go I actually spent most of my school years in special needs, Jeremy Yes, and there we are, so that'soh that's a good one, and around the last one into Gambon, - you got into 2nd, - go on go on go on always a risk, but come on, come on, come on, nice one, nice one.
now plainly and obviously, Gordon did have a sticky hot grippy day so you're not gonna beat him, so where do you think, bearing in mind well if I can't Gordon then at least let me be right up his arse.
I don't know what to say now, ok this is the fastest wet lap we've had, Philip Glenister 1:54.
3 , these are super hot laps excuse me, we're talking about wet laps, does everyone in the audience not think that snow has a di slightly different context? - I'm sorry, I don't recall seeing snow there.
- Well It wasn't snowing! It was wet.
Ah You're having a "wet" Put "w/s" Wet, and you did it You've changed, Jeremy.
Wet lap, 1 minute, Well that's sort of a relief.
Oh so close, oh so close The fastthat is an astonishing time, genuinely.
We were absolutely staggered, the Stig ah Melted snow, - which is water.
- That's pretty good, though, isn't it? It's better than pretty good, honestly and genuinely the Stig is just standing openwell we think he's open mouthed it's hard to say, just can't believe how good you were.
It's All credits to the Stig I say.
No, all credits to you, all credits to the fact that somehow it seems that Britain's fastest people are chefs.
-Come on! - Heaven knows why.
just to massage my ego, coz you know, our chefs are quite competitive, what I want to know is what does wet/melted snow what in seconds what does that give me back? I would say, and IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½m really sorry about this Gordon coz I know you're watching like this, four.
(SING) Come on now! And then miraculously in the edit Oh just, just for today, - just, just keep it there, just for today.
- I'll leave it up there just for today anyway, there you go, Jamie Oliver! Thank you.
Now Now, this is a Jaguar XK8.
We drove it on the last series and we loved it.
But we always sort of knew that it was a support actor really a kind of warm-up man for the main event, the supercharged XKR, which I haven't been driving.
Jeremy selflessly protected me from that one.
This is it.
It has big wheels vents in the bonnet brushed aluminum gills and a sort of stubbly Coulthardy chin So you can think of it as the standard car with cufflinks and a nice watch You've got to say, it looks good.
In profile especially, it's just stunning.
Sadly however I can't say the same for the interior.
I'm sorry but this just doesn't feel like a 73,000 pound car.
I mean Mercedes give you seats that massage you as you drive along and BMW gives you i-Drive All I've got in here, a sort of five acres of tin-foil.
The supercharged 4.
2 litre V8 is a bit disappointing too.
Because it's pretty much exactly the same as the supercharged 4.
2 litre V8 they put in the old XKR.
Merck gives us a new engine every five minutes.
Audi designed a whole new V8 while I was just saying that.
But Jag's been making this one for nearly ten years now.
So come on, chop, chop! Yes it generates 420 BHP, but Merck is now making engines with 520 BHP, and BMW isn't far behind.
The only good thing is that the XKR is quite light.
So while it doesn't have a shed load of power, it's stillÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ quite fast.
You pass 60 miles an hour in 4.
9 seconds.
You pass 100 in 13 seconds, and that's good.
But imagine how good it would be if it had more POWER! Now you might think at this point "Well there you go, it's a half-arse car made by a cash strapped company" "and that it is no match for its German rivals.
" Then you'd be wrong, because this carÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ is brilliant! The standard car sounds pretty good but this is deeper, ruder.
Like Tom Jones gaggling in NASCAR.
And then is the handling.
It has got an absolutely fabulous chassis.
It is the easiest car in the world to drive if you are lunatic.
Honestly I know of nothing else that's this good for slithering about the smoke pouring off the back end.
Look here we go.
Sliding, still sliding, still sliding, no danger, still sliding.
I mean that's doing power slides at like 110 mph, easily! This is justÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ makes a BMW or a Mercedes look like they're made of wood.
And the great thing is that, when you take your looney-tunes hat off, and just settle down.
It becomes all quite and comfortable.
It really is Dr.
Jimmy and Mr.
Jim.
Yes it has less power and fewer toys than its German rivals.
And it's made with less satisfactory ingredients.
But it is a damn sight cheaper and I'm sorry to keep hopping on about this, a damn sight better looking as well.
I know that is a particularly horrible colour.
But imagine it in silver or black.
And then imagine walking away from it and buying a Mercedes or a BMW instead.
I'm not sure I could.
Ah.
Yes you're thinking this is all very interesting.
But what about the Jag's main rival, its sister, This.
The Aston Martin V8 Vantage.
It's even better looking than the Jag, and that's just the start.
It's also even louder.
It's harder too, much more aggressive, much more taut and angry.
And it's an Aston Martin, which is a royal flush to the Jag's two pairs The thing is though, as you stir away on the manual gearbox and you ride the wave of noise feel the grip from these super sticky Pirelli tires, you realize, you ain't actually pulling away from the Jaguar.
Feels like I'm going faster, sounds like I'm going faster, and my heart is certainly beating faster.
But, my rear view mirror is still full of Jag.
You must imagine that flat out in a straight line, the Aston will pull away 'cause the Jag's limited to 155, but hahaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ we tested one the other day and the Jag sailed up to 175.
So, while the Aston is more exciting, the Jaguar is more powerful.
It's also 12,500 ponds less expensive.
It's more comfortable.
It's better equipped with goodies like full leather and satellite navigation.
And it's got two small seats in the back.
So it's a bit more practical as well.
Emotionally then, this car beats anything from Mercedes and BMW and on points it beats its sister as well.
It is quite simply, spectacular! Yeah.
And you knowÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ That's what I was actually filmingÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ I was actually making that film the day you crashed.
Yeah, a much better day than I did though.
Well, that's because I am a better driver.
- Whatever.
- I justÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ I just stayed on the gravel.
Anyway, listen.
You know that thing I said aboutÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ You'd buy this because it's got two extra seats in the back.
- Yeah, yeah.
- The Aston hasn't got any.
- Irrelevant.
- Why? Because while you're away, OK, imagining that you're a dog.
- Chicken.
- Chicken.
Whatever, OK.
The EU had said that now if you're your height, you've got to have like a booster seat.
- No seriously, they have.
- Yeah.
I know it came to here.
The thing is that to fit in there you got to be your height, but now you've got to have a seat.
- Yeah? - Which means you aren't gonna fit.
Oh, you'll be too big with a booster seat And no one will ever be able to get in the back.
That's gonna be the same for all these 2+2s with tiny little back seats then Exactly, the EU's rendered them useless, so you might as well buy the Aston on that front.
Thing is though, I do still really adore this car.
And now we've gotta find out how fast it goes round our track.
And that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
Some say he once threw a microwave oven at a tramp, and that long before anyone else he realized that Jade Goody was a racist pig-faced waste of blood and organs.
But he didn't.
All we know is he's called the Stig.
And he's off.
We can hear the super charger whining over that thunderous V8 base line.
Just look how wet it is out there.
Ok Stig ploughs fearlessly into that corner.
Radio: I change my mind.
I want the chance to spend the rest of my life, loving you.
Oh dear, the Stig seems to have developed a taste for romantic fiction on CD.
OK, he's through Chicago, sliding around like a go-cart.
Here he is coming into Hammerhead.
Plagues of melted snow every where.
Is he gonna understeer? Not a bit of it.
Look at that! You see there is no car that drifts like this one.
With the backward plaining.
Radio: With her own golden haired ruddy faced Archilles He's really got the hammer down now.
you see the car twitching over the standing water.
Stig isn't faced.
Maybe it's 'cause his home planet is quite swampy.
ErrÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½/panel to the corner, dips into the grass, Gambon now, hard in, chucks it side ways and across the line! Now he did it in 1:34.
7, which is obvious pathetic, but I think it was really very very very wet.
Err.
.
we were gonna put the Aston round afterwards, but it started to snow again, so don't blame us Err 'cause we didn't bother, don't blame the Stig do what every one else does.
And just blame Global Warming.
Now earlier on we set out on a mission to demonstrate that roadworks needn't take so long Warwickshire council reckoned it will take 5 days to resurface a 1.
5 mile stretch of the D5481.
But we reckoned, by working hard, and not get all tangled up in Health and Safty We could do it in just 24 hours And when we left the action it was going really rather well I thought.
Hammond here was down at the quarry keeping up a steady stream of fresh tarmac I was driving a paver laying it on the road and Jeremy was fulfilling the vital role of shouting at everyone down a megaphone.
Come on! Put it back into it.
You, man, here, let me show you.
But then all of a sudden everything went wrong.
Run out of tarmac! What do you mean you've run out? For Hammonds lorry's not here.
We need a thousand tons.
And his lorry load only does that little stretch there.
And if he doesn't get it here quick enough that pitchinging stuff goes off and it won't stick.
Hammond we're out! We've done 100 feet.
How many trucks have you got working on this? We've got three in here now We've got one be loaded one on the way bridge that I can see.
And I am I can't get anymore in it.
You've only got five trucks? Right.
Are there any other roadwork's going on today? - What? That we can nick their tarmac? - Yeah.
I like your thinking there.
that's quite devious.
Nick their tarmac.
Your next job, do you know where it's going? Is it going to You see that's not our road Well that's useless.
Send it to us.
Just don't send it to them.
We need it.
Crack now to the max.
And change that calendar.
It's far too calming and relaxing.
Move! Come on! Go! Fast, Get on with it! Hahahh, another one.
I cracked the whip and even introduced an incentive scheme.
I want you to go like the wind, OK? I'll pay you speeding fines.
But the fact remained that the quarry was an hour away.
And Hammond only had five trucks.
That wasn't enough.
The main reason why roadworks take a long time is because the trucks just don't come regularly enough.
- That guy that you're working with.
- Yeah.
He said he's worked till the way it is now for 32 years We told Hammond this.
We said to Hammond it's the only important thing: keep the trucks coming.
The tarmac did continued to dribbled in, but far too slowly, and then Back at the quarry What's killed it? Why is it stopped? Emergency stop.
Why is it in the emergency stop? There is no Who's lent, we've lent on the what? - Who's - Your man.
The camera man lent we lent on the emergency You stopped the plant? Yeah, we sort of hit the emergency stop a bit.
Why have you done that? Well this was a bloody accident, wasn't it.
I didn't do it on purpose.
Richard, Richard, Richard I'm gonna make a suggestion: Don't come back here.
Don't don't come back, go away, go to Tierra del Tierra del Fuego, and even I'm gonna hunt you down and kill you there as well.
Men at the D5481 This is our darkest hour We will not allow Adolf Hammond to ruin our plans for this great, this wonderful, this magnificent Shut up! We buried the Health and Safety man While we waited for the quarry to restart.
But it didn't It was five o'clock, knocking-off time.
And they'd all gone home.
We've shut down the plant, that That's it.
We can't work anymore.
Well, your friends're on a 35-hour week Most jobs would stop at this point.
But we used our initiative and found a new quarry that would stay open through the night.
Where is it? This new one? - Ashbourne - Ashbourne? - That's in Kent.
- In Derbyshire.
If I go over to Ashbourne with the other plant? Don't go to Ashbourne, don't go anywhere near a quarry.
You're ruining it.
And then just as we were getting on top of things.
In the immortal words of Basil Fawlty: "Oh spiffing!" If a storm broke it wouldn't matter how much tarmac came.
'Cause we wouldn't be able to lay it.
Plainly, a speech was in order.
We shall not go quietly into the night.
We are faced diversity in the day shift, but As night fell, the rain came.
And in a normal roadworks that would be that.
But I refused to let anyone stop Because the second quarry had just started to deliver.
This is a sight to warm the cockles of your heart.
- Marvelous.
- Men working at night.
You're always hearing people say that 'I went to Japan and they work through the night.
' 'I went to Switzerland, they work through the night.
' Here we are in England and we're working through the night.
And to make sure that people of Bidford got their work done quickly We've been working through our supper break as well.
Can I have Cod and chips, 75 times - And a butter sausage.
- Yes, thank you.
- Chips! - Ohh! Yeah, but don't just grab them, I got to hand them out, I got a job for you.
- Can you hand out the wipes? - Yeah.
- That'll appreciate - There you go.
While Richard was getting supper, I'd installed another motivational tool to keep everyone spirits up.
The night is dark, the road is long.
And we are far from our families.
But don't worry, Gentlemen at D5481, Because I have music to take us through the night! Chech it out! It's put me off the sausage.
/One-all, James.
This is how you run roadworks Good fish and chips, good music No Health and no Safty.
I just think that this is the happiest roadwork crew working in the land right now anywhere.
The guys also like the willingness of the bosses to muck in.
And with that in mind, James and Richard took over the roller.
You've got to, just overlap the edge of this.
If I go too far over the edge just stick it in the verge, and then you've got to.
.
No, God, bugger You've run over the stop cock you cock.
I heard it go clanging.
Woo, that's bad, we are gonna in trouble.
Who are we gonna tell about this? Ahh.
Well, what we could do is take steamroller.
- And just keep going? - Yeah.
At 4 am, there were still 700 yards to go.
And the men were flagging.
So, I brought out the motivational big gun another Winter of discontent? This is Mrs Thatcher - Yeah.
- To motivate the men.
This is going well.
And I hope it will be followed by a Winter of common sense.
Yes, I like that one.
Don't encourage him, man, this is The chaps however were not telegraph readers like James So I promised them that the sooner they finish the laying the sooner I'll switch her off.
That worked, and by day break the road was resurfaced But there were still only time for a quick power breakfast.
Why do tramps live in London? - When there is all this out here.
- Yeah.
We'd promised the people of Bidford they'd have their road back by 9:07 And there was still much to do The plants needed clearing Hammond needed to get the signs back up.
And James and I had the white lines to paint.
Look, that's a little bit, OK? - That perfect.
- It isn't.
Hahhaha.
.
We did our best, but the men from the council didn't seem impressed.
Hehahaha.
.
We had made a terrible mess of the lines and with the clock ticking we ram to see Hammond, who've made a even bigger mess with his signs.
The hill is there, And that's you're going that way.
They should be facing that way.
You're right, I'm just telling people they've just been around some bends.
- And down a hill.
- Go away, leave me lone.
Alright.
As it turned out, he's done them all wrong.
And we had just ten minutes to put them right.
Oh, bloody hell! - Did you do this stuff? - Yeah.
- Right, stand back.
How did you do it - There you go.
Perfect.
- There.
That's it, finished.
- Open road! - Right.
I've been wanting to do this for a long time.
Oh, come on! I'm coming.
You're the one who's been shouting all day.
So there you are.
People of Bidford-on-Avon in just under one day, your road is open.
Glad to be of service.
If we can do that If we can do that.
They should be able to do that.
Really we do have some Top Gear top tips here for the construction industry.
Work fast, Eat blackberries Get 100 trucks, not 5.
Yeah, and fit that paving machine thing with a turbo charger - Yeah, and don't let him drive it - No, don't do that.
Anyway, now, it's the moment you've all been waiting for.
Devena is live on state of the Big Brother.
winner is about to be announced.
Here on BBC2 however we got our little fella's car crash So come on mate, talk us through it.
Oh Ok.
Well, and look, we got some video of it we never looked.
Here is umm.
.
Here's before it happened.
This is the car.
It's called the Vampire.
Basically it's just a socking great jet engine with a chair bolted to the front of it.
That's it.
So is it high tech? Yes, it's fairly high tech.
The engine, the jet engine, comes out of a Red Arrow.
The steering box is from a Reliant Robin.
And the fuel pumps from a cement mixer.
Oh, that's the airfield where I was gonna be driving it.
- See, that's in Elvington near York.
- Oh, it's complicated.
There is of course one thing you really don't want when you're doing this sort of stuff up a runway.
Like that one.
Cross winds.
Yeah, there was a bit of breeze.
Oh that was me getting in it, you see.
At there and And then I got a briefing from the man who built it.
So my challenge today is to drive this thing, except, that's not the full story Because my challenge today is to drive this thing and hit this innocent-looking little button.
Because when I do that, it sends a flame, shooting through the engine which ignites the afterburner.
And when that happens I haven't got 5,000 horse power, I've got, 10,000 horse power, I'm possibly the biggest accident, you've ever seen in your life.
I bet when you said that, it was one of those Yeah! Pathetic, very pathetic.
And I bet when you said that you thought it's one of those snappy lines to make this look a bit more dangerous than it really is.
It's exactly what I thought when I said it.
Can I just qualify something about it? Is it It doesn't have like a throttle in the accelerator.
- Like a normal car.
- No, a jet car.
No, it is complete different to drive.
There is no clutches or such.
You just turn the engine up to what you want with the knob on the dash.
That's before you set off.
Yeah, you do that when you start it, you leave it.
So there is no accelerator.
You pull away by just taking you foot off the footbrake.
You don't touch that again.
So when you're going along, what you've got is a steering wheel and a lever to stop the engine and pull the parachute.
So it's quite simple.
Oh, it's easier to control than your chair, mate.
Ok, well, let's have a look what happened next.
Let us get these, err just keep your arms through there.
What're they for? These are arm strands Uh, in event if you're going upside down.
They'll stop your arms coming out of the cockpit I don't want to go upside down.
Throttle Set to half.
OK, so ignition Bloody hell fire.
That's a jet's engine.
Holy crap.
This is terrifying! Here we go.
This is it.
Oh my god.
The feel's just unbelievable.
And it's vibrating.
Oh my God, Oh my God! I can feel it pulling to the right! I'm on the black tarmac.
/ / /, I need a parachute That is Oh, it's amazing.
Ah (DEEP BREATH) Ahhh! I just want to go faster.
More speed.
How quick was that.
Eh, that's 220.
4.
- 220.
- Yeah.
Now we are achieving pretty close to that kind of speed now on our own runway here.
So what's the difference you say a Lambo here and that? It's just the way the jet engine delivers the power.
You're aware that there is so much of it.
Just a huge amount of power going on.
So it's a sensation of that more than the actual speed.
How did you know though when to pull the parachute lever.
En, well we just put some cones out on the runway so You see I would have pull it much sooner than that.
I'm off! It's gone.
I'd pulled it before I set off.
Just in case.
With hindsight, yeah.
Bet better idea perhaps.
OK, so next time it was the afterburner.
Yes, absolutely.
And you can see that in the film, can you? Yeah, you'll see that no one is lit because this flame's coming out of the back of the engine.
OK.
Now I have to explain to everybody in case you don't know An afterburner is really only fits to the fastest military jets.
Or, and Concord, actually, for that matter.
A Harrier jump jet, for instance, doesn't have one.
Ok, it's not deemed necessary for that.
But he was about to light one in a car.
Yeah.
Well I wanted to do this, And now I am.
I've emm I'd be lying if I said I wasn't quite scared.
However I think it's the fact that once you started, that's it.
You don't mess about with the throttle.
Once it go, you go.
That's, you know commitment.
Here we go, here we go, here we go, come on.
This is it.
I've got to / Ohh Hahaaaa! You / Yes, I can't describe.
I I think I'm gonna cry.
I'm not joking.
Every part of my body is full of adrenaline Oh, yes.
I'm so alive.
I'm so alive.
Now that looked really quick.
That was quicker.
That was 314 miles an hour.
And that is the fastest anyone's actually traveled in Britain before, isn't it? Well, technically, I suppose it is.
'Cause I think the British land speed record is 301 miles an hour.
- In that car? - Yes.
- Nobody's gonna beat it.
- No, probably not now.
No.
But to be an official record, you've got do another run in the other direction then take an average of the 2 speeds.
The worse we know from telemetry that that was 314, - Oh yeah! - that's the fastest anyone's ever traveled.
Oh yeah, but it's not, you know, official record.
So what's it feel like? Eh, fast.
Eh, it's I weren't trying to set a record.
I just wanted to get really really fast.
- But you did 314 - Yeah.
- and you wanted to know what it was like to go really fast.
- Yeah.
So you'd found out.
Why didn't you just get in your car and go home.
I don't know really.
Emm, the thing is that run that you just saw that was at 5 o'clock and we had the runway until 5:30.
And I know now obviously, Eh, I don't know, I think it's a bit like, you know, when you were a kid, and you are out playing with your mates.
And then your Mom would shout for you to come in for your tea.
And you just pushing a bit and keep going a bit longer.
And that's always when you fall out of the tree.
With hindsight again, yes Well, alright.
I suppose this it is then, isn't it really now? This is what happened next, yeah.
It was all over quite quickly so do it again in slow motion.
You can see the moment when the tire goes.
It's still doing 288 miles an hour here.
But then it's off.
It's away.
I think it's about 0.
4 of a second really from the tire blowing to it all going wrong.
Then when it digs in on the grass, the car rolls.
It's still doing 230 when it's upside down on the grass which is so here now it's still doing 230 mph when it's upside and down.
Then it flips a bit.
And then it settles down.
And the rollbar digs into the ground along with my head.
And that stops it very quickly, Indeed.
Oh, thank you.
The tragedy is, that would be the fastest car crash ever in Britain.
But the Genis world records' people saying you got do it going in the other direction.
I don't want the record.
It's not what I want.
So you've come away with no record at all for having done that.
That's a bit of a tragedy.
The thing is though, can I just ask, you can see again in the crash run, Ok, your last run.
The tire is starting to come apart.
Ok, if we watch this you can see it, look at it, on the right end tyre.
Look there.
Now I'm sorry mate, why didn't you spot that.
Well I hadn't known all/.
I was doing 288 miles an hour.
I can have a lot.
I'm in the office the kids are shouting, I'm writting a story and I'm on the phone.
If a lion walks in I'm going to notice it.
It was 0.
4 of a second from the tire started to go to the accident started.
I could have held it.
What, in the world's longest power slide? Whilst telling us about the price and there was no room in the boot? - Easy-peasy.
- Yeah.
The problem is fundamentally you weren't wearing your EU booster seat.
You were too low and you couldn't see it.
If I had a booster seat on, my head would have come off when it rolled eventually.
Have you read the highway codes? Well, I didn't have a copy with me.
Because it quite plainly says here, When the car goes out of control, steer into the skid.
He's right.
Look, the expert guys that did the telemetry that was on the car you know the computers and stuff, they said I had the reactions of a fighter pilot.
They didn't say it was a World War I fighter pilot.
That I've been in my / with / wooden fighter, exactly.
No, I think we could sit here as we have done for the last few months and take the Mickey out of you.
The fact is though I would just like to say: you were very brave to getting in that thing.
It's not something I would have done.
It certainly not something he would have done.
But more than that I think you've just performed a miracle and really brave getting well and getting back on the show again.
Thanks mate.
You've You just been nice to me.
I promise, I promise I'll never do it again, ever.
Good, talking about things will never happen again That we never mention that crash on Top Gear again.
- Never.
- Ever.
You up for that? - What? - Never gonna mention the crash.
There you go.
We will never mention that crash again.
That's a promise.
We won't mention it now 'cause that is the end of the show.
The thing is though we have learned an important lesson today.
Thanks to Richard.
Do please remember.
Speed kills.
See you next week.
Take care.
Thanks for watching.

<|endoftext|>


Hello and welcome! Thank you for that! Thank you.
Now Now as I'm sure you know As I'm sure you know, James May is the slowest man in the entire world By the time he sets off anywhere normally his hair has grown another inch.
So, plainly, He was the ideal man to try and max the fastest car in the world.
"Vlad the impaler" is back.
Last year, the mighty Bugatti Veyron starred in our greatest Top Gear Challenge ever when it raced an air-plane across the continent.
In that film, Jeremy talked endlessly about the Veyron's ferocious power, and its incredible top speed.
But because he was on public road he had to stick to the speed limit.
Hahahaha.
.
But today, we're not going to talk about it.
We are going to do it.
We're going to take the fastest production car in the world up to its top speed.
That top speed is 253 mph.
Much faster than a formular 1 car.
and when you think that the Veyron has air-bags, air-conditioning, a stereo, a boot and all the other stuff F1 cars aren't burdened with You realize what an increadible machine this is! The Veyron is about pushing the outside of the envelope It's about doing things that people said just were not possible This car is a sort of "Concord" moment.
Getting cars to do 155 mph frankly isn't really very difficult.
the Veyron needs just a piffling 270 bhp to reach that speed.
But 253! Crikey! the faster you go, the more Mother Nature tries to hold you back So to do the next 100 mph the 100 mhp that takes you up to 250 needs another 730 Bhp.
So what you end up with is a 16-cylinder engine with 4 turbo chargers producing 1001 horse power.
and a lot of heat.
That's why your car has 1 radiator and this car has 10.
The engineers really worried uncharted territory in this car.
Here is an example, when they wanted to sort out the high speed dynamics They went to the Sauber F1 Team and they said "Do you mind awfully if we use your wind tunnel?" and they said "Terribly sorry, but we don't go up to those speeds" In fact, cracking 253 mph cause nighimare after nightmaire.
But Bugatti insist that this 850,000 pound car can do it.
Mind you, actually testing their bold claim is a bit of a palaver.
This is Ehra-Lessien Volkswagon's maximum security test track in Germany When it was built during the cold war It was delibrately sited in a no fly zone near the east German border in order to stop prying eyes from seeing secret prototypes It has over 16 miles of private track.
But the bit we are interested in is the main straight, which is a whopping 5.
5 miles long.
Although it is technically a flat and level road.
You stand here, you can't actually see the other end and that's because it's following the curvature of the earth.
But even when you've sorted the venue you can't just jump in the car and go.
This is Germany, there are procedures to go through.
I like procedures You have to insert a special key into a slot by the door.
And when you do, the diffuser flaps close.
the rear spoiler retracts and the whole car hunkers down to became as slippery as possible The telemetry box we're using to record the speed measures in kilometers an hours.
So the magic number we are looking for is 407 Right ladies and gentleman Here we go.
I'm approaching the banking on the top of the circuit I have to do this in 200 kph That's about 120 Round the banking look for my acceleration point then give it the beans down the straight To get the car settled fourth gear 5000 revs Looking for the exit where I bury it.
Here we go! The climb from 200 to 300 kph was over in just 9.
4 seconds The world, viewers, is a total blur! I'm already doing 330 Kph Going too quick, I can't do the math.
Gettng up to about 350 Captain Slow is doing 360 kph 370 That's 230 miles per hour.
I was now leaving F1 cars behind It's no wonder Micheal Schumacher retired.
He's slower than me! At this sort of speed this engine is sucking in as much air in a minute as I breathe in four days Getting close to the maximum which means the tires would only last for about 15 minutes But it's OK Because the fuel runs out in 12 minutes This is a road car and I'm getting up to 404 Come on give me one more! Come on I need one more, one more! I'm covering a football pitch every second That I'm pretty confident that's as fast as I'm ever gonna go in a car.
Increadible That is it's made my eyes water.
I am impressed, James OK.
thing is though, OK.
You know when you take a Ferrari or a Lamborghini or particularly a Koenigzegg to its top speed - No.
- No, actually you wouldn't But anyway, when you do They fizz they buzz They feels like all the body panels are peeling away 'cause you're right on the edge of what's physically and technically possible.
Really? I didn't get any of that with this.
.
To be honest, the only thing I've got was at the end of the straight I had to touch the breaks, so you see the spoiler come up slowing down.
You got a sort of And that's it? Yeah, just So it's kind of safe and relaxing even at 250 miles an hour Absolutely, yeah.
It's totally undramatic.
But I would give you a bit of warning which is a bit disorientating doing that sort of speed.
'Cause, after I come off the banking I was slowing down to stop You know how you get a bit impatient, you think "I'll just open the door" Fortunately I looked back at the speedo and I was still doing 70 Umm.
.
OK, so.
We've established that this is faster across Europe than - your light ari-craft - Yepp.
We've established that it realy will do 250 mph But we've never been able to find out how fast it'll go round our track Now the problem is Bugatti are happy for us to have one here.
They are happy for you to go and do that.
But they won't lend the Stig one.
Umm.
.
So really, this is an appeal.
If you've got a Veyron and you'd like to lend it to us.
We're prepared to pay anything up to 30 pounds And now the news and we start off with the Porsche Cayenne because they've revised it and come out with a new one It's got new prices, new bits and pieces, new engines, But the most important thing of course about a Cayenne is it's never been the best-looking car, is it? No, not even slightly.
Well, we can only assume that this new one still isn't exactly the best-looking car because well, here is the official photograph that Porsche sent out for us.
I can hear the discussion of the photographer had actually with the director.
He said "Is the light good for you?" and he said "No, there is still is some.
" Yes, exactly.
Now, hey, you know that young Russian business kid who bought TVR a couple of years ago? Yeah.
Yeah, we've got a picture of him here at a business meeting - Oh, yeah, there he is - There Did he close down the factory in Blackpool and make everyone redundant.
Exactly, well, it turns out that all the TVR owners have decided that they're gonna throw a party for the workers who've all been made redundant.
The party dubbed fundable will include a buffet dinner, How much do I don't want to go to that? Err, bar disco and live band.
Wahl, a TVR band.
So they'll play presumably really loud really fast and then burst into flames.
Here's some news, you know the hot Renault Clio, there was a really fast one They've done a even hotter one, OK? It's call the R27 It's got a lower stiffer chassis.
We've got a photograph of it here, OK? Now, these are the four Renault formula 1 racing drivers, OK, for this year.
Now this chap, OK, the new one, He really likes this car, he is very excited by it.
He is very, very excited He is very pleased to see it, isn't he? Really pleased.
What I love as well, If you look around the other guys, who clearly spotted the problem.
Well, you could hardly miss it, could you.
They're all very embarrassed.
Don't look Well, you see this, Ok, I got this photograph from a French website.
The actually official photograph that was sent to it by Renault Let me show it to you.
Look, there's he, go and stand behind the car now.
- Look how embarrassing he is.
- But they are all racing drivers.
Couldn't they've lent a crash helmet to hold it in the appropriate way.
It was his crash helmet that caused the problem in the first place.
Leave it Err, oh, now News from the director of public prosecutions who I discovered in the paper this week he is called Can or something rather Not called Can.
Can is the name of a man you borrow a step ladder from Yeah.
Not the director of public prosecutions.
Can has announced that there is a whole raft of new motoring offences for which you can go to prison, OK? One of them is, retuning your radio.
- Oh, don't, it's stupid.
- What? Seriously But what if the Archers comes on? I can't listen to an episode of the Archers in the car without losing my temper and having a crash deliberately to end it? Can has decided that we'll have to tolerate these things, cause you're not allowed to retune a radio, you're also not allowed to put lipstick on.
Again, what But get this one.
You are not allowed now to be an undertaker.
What? I don't got it, an undertaker? You an undertaker? You're undertaker? You're going to prison.
Can says, Can says if you "undertake" someone, Oh, hang on.
Well, it's I've always had been a bit of beef about this.
because I reckon if you go pass someone on the inside, There was room to do that, there was room for them to have got out of the way in the first place.
It's wrong! They are the ones who should be prosecuted.
They can't find prisons to put pedophiles in.
But they're going to be putting him in it for being an undertaker.
It's ridiculous.
You know actually they can't find the pedophiles cause 300 have got missing.
I know where they are.
If you drive down the outside lane of the motorway now, not retune the radio at 50 miles an hour, OK? You are immune from prosecution, OK? So it's the ideal place to go if you're being looked for by the law.
So therefore anyone doing 50 in the outside lane of the motorway is a child molester.
Wahl, that's amazing.
You use logic, there.
That's incredible.
Argue with that.
Hey, now, can I just say, OK it's been a while since we sat here as a group as you know, so I thought it would be a good idea just to count through a few of the good cars and bad cars we've driven when we've been off air and I have to say, good cars for me, Lexus.
particularly, actually, the GS, the one in the middle I'm with you.
The hybrid one, mate No, no, this one, OK? This looks like a normal car.
The great thing is, OK, its batteries will only take you less than a mile which means most of the time you are on the V6, you know, you chewing fuel, you warming the world, and everybody is happy, OK? It's very quiet, it's very fast, it's very very comfortable.
And of course you can drive it to London, do U turns on Piccadilly all day long can't Livingston cop charge you a penny.
- Brilliant car there.
- It is a hybrid.
It's a properly brilliant car there.
I'm gonna put like a little 9 volt battery in a Hummer.
It's a hybrid.
I was very impressed if I maybe buy the Suzuki Swift Sport.
- I am.
- No, it's This is the most underrated It's not going over well mate, it's not going over well.
Before you all chime in, it's a small car, but, you know I'm not a big fan of the new Mini I've just It's too big and lump and all the rest of it That I think is the new Mini.
Try it, you'll be amazed.
It's brilliant that car.
That's an order from him.
Actually, to be honest, I quite like that as well.
I, I actually really did the Volvo C30.
I know, don't think I gone mad.
But it's a good looking car.
And you can get it with a 5 cylinder engine which is exactly the same one as in the Focus ST, the hot one.
Worst cars, no question for me.
One of the top 5 worst cars I've ever driven.
VW Golf GT.
There.
No, seriously, it's got a supercharged and turbocharged engine, which is as smooth as falling down stairs while wearing leg calipers.
Basically if you tend to buy one of those, honestly, just work harder and buy the Golf GTI.
- There is a Top Gear top tip.
- Good advice.
I was pretty disappointed, I hate I have to say this a Bentley Arnage T, not the R which is brilliant.
This is a useful consumer advice for people in the north.
Well actually it is.
And I'm sorry it is.
Because the T has a bit more power and a bit more torque and it's just enough to spoil it.
If you stick with the R, which is the beautiful car, they cost 12,000 pounds less so you can buy a house.
For me, it was the Subaru Tribeca which is a MPV and technically it's not bad but it's hideous and it's a family car.
So my kids would too terrify to get in it.
Hating it.
it's not it's just it's hideous.
Hey, now, Jaguar have made a concept car.
Well, not another one.
It's why they never make any money, isn't it? because they just keep making concept cars all the time instead of just making cars that you can buy.
Well I know, they haven't understood that if you sell a car, you get money.
Yeah.
Anyway, this one, OK? They say, which I've got a picture of it here.
OK? They say, that's going to be the next S type.
It will be looking exactly the same as that.
Well, if that's true, that's fantastic news.
It looks brilliant.
I know.
It does.
I went to see it in the flesh the other day.
The designer was there and he said "I assure you, the S type will look exactly like that.
" If that car comes out like that, I'll cut my left leg off, beat myself to death with it.
- Really? - Yeah.
Do it.
Make it, just make it.
Now, if you're looking to spend between your choice just became a lot more complicated.
So, to see if we could help you out, the three of us have been to Scotland for a row.
These are the cars that have caused the problem.
There is the new Audi TT, the new Alfa Romeo Brera, and the not so new, but still quite interesting Mazda RX-8 So, let's start with the Audi.
Now I want to make it absolutely plain that I did not like the old TT.
Because all they did to make it was put a Golf in a pretty front.
That's like putting a cow in a track suit.
Still not gonna win any running races.
With this new one though, they really have gone to towns.
It's longer, wider and more aggressive than the old model.
And even though this is the baby of the range, it's more technical as well.
Take the body for example, from here back, it's steel, from here forwards, it's aluminum.
And that not only makes the car lighter, it's actually 9 stone less than the old TT, it also improves weight distribution.
Then there is the suspension, the fluid in the shock absorber has got iron filings in it, then round the outside there is a magnet, turn the magnet on, your iron filings move about, everything becomes firmer.
And how much do you not want to go on a holiday with a man who thought of that.
The upshot is, this is no longer a cow in a track suit.
It's a cow GTI in racing overall.
The steering in the old car was numb, in this, it feels connected.
The ride in the old car was as comfortable as falling down a flight of stairs, in this, it's smooth when the iron filings are dormant and then when you push the switch to turn the magnets on it becomes racing car sharp.
This is not a car for taking your hair to the hair dresses any more, this is a car for making your hair stand on end it's a proper sports car.
Rubbish! What you want is one of these.
This is the new Alfa Romeo Brera.
It's a brilliant car.
On the face of it, the Alfa is exactly like the TT.
They are both four-seat coupes, they've both got four-cylinder engines, they've both got six-speed gearboxes, they both cost around 24,000 pounds, and they'll both also be available with But actually, this is not like a TT at all.
Now we've said this time and again on Top Gear You can not consider yourself a true petrolhead until you've owned an Alfa Romeo.
They're not cars for posers, they're cars for connoisseurs.
there're some times, they'll infuriate you other times, they're really gonna thrill and excite you, but the point is: they're never, ever boring.
It was not designed like the Audi, using just science and technology and iron filings, It also has soul and passion.
This car has a heart.
But you know what really swings it for me? It's the interior.
Sitting in here feels like you're sitting in a Milanese's espresso bar.
Sitting in the Audi feels like you're trapped in a Berlin post office.
OK, then, James, have you told the ladies and gentlemen how fast the Brera goes from 0-60 No, I haven't and I was rather hoping you wouldn't bring it up.
But never mind, ladies and gentlemen, it does it in 8.
1 seconds.
Which in 1976 would have been considered pretty brisk.
James, you could be out dragged but a canoe boat.
It's not a slow car, it's just not quite as quick as your car.
which is a car for people who use moisturizing products.
James, I'm with you.
I prefer an Alfa to an Audi.
But not that Alfa Romeo, that's too slow and that's an end of it.
It's not too slow, it's plenty fast enough James, our colleague has arrived.
Here he is Lord Woolworth is here.
If it's power you want, then this is your answer.
The wankel engined Mazda RX-8.
When it comes to speed, it will do 0-60 in 6.
4 seconds, That's a bit faster than the Audi and a whole lot faster than the Alfa.
Top speed, 'round 150.
Put it on a track, and you quickly realize what this car is all about.
About this engine, it is different, it's a rotary.
So you use it differently.
All the power is at the top end.
So you can crush it mercilessly, an it will thank you for it.
There is something else too.
The Alfa is basically just an Alfa saloon underneath, And the Audi is just an Golf in a fancy front.
The RX-8, however, is bespoke.
It was designed from the ground up to be a preliminary sports car.
This is the only one with rear wheel drive.
It is a proper blue-blooded driver's car.
Listen to that, 7, 8 ,9 And yet despite all that, it has four doors.
You see, you got your big door at the front, usual sort of thing, then you got the little door for back seat passengers.
Look at that.
It's brilliant.
There're a few disadvantages I admit.
You'll struggle to get more than 23 MPG, it uses quite a lot of oil, and the depreciation is a bit steep.
But then a RX-8 is 2,000 pounds cheaper to buy than the others, and 2000 times better.
And I don't care what those other idiots say.
A tricky decision then, three similar cars, but three different opinions.
To see if we could find a winner, the three of us needed to meet up.
So this being Scotland, the home of golf.
We decided to break out the Pringle.
What will you be using here? How the hell do I know? I've never ever played golf.
And it's like that, isn't it? I can't believe you.
You seem to look like somebody who've done it Hahaha You've got dressed up in that outfit to do that.
To be honest, I could've carried it that far.
That doesn't look right.
How could it not look right? Shut up, watch and learn.
- Wow! - It's gone in the sea.
- It's gone in the sea.
- Yeah.
I will tell you what, Richard, Your Mazda would look good here.
Get off, it is not a golfist's car.
- It is actually.
- That actually is.
I'm fairly confident you won't see an Alfa Romeo in the car park.
No, we won't.
But I'm afraid I could see your car as well.
- TT? - Yeah.
TT is the car for the kind of man who matches his belt to the little tag on these trousers and he is then proud and pleased with that.
- What do they do and got they could do this, don't they? He's gonna do it again.
- It's like his pre-fly checks - I'll kill him, I'm going to kill him.
That's quite Well it wasn't bad.
Well, it was.
I just got a hole in 21.
We were extremely quick at getting to a new hole.
Oh - Oh, no - Hahaha Oh, well done.
But every time we got there Yes! Hahaha things slowed down again.
Are you using an ace? Partly because we were useless and partly because we kept arguing about our cars.
That Mazda is chintzy, it's nearly as chintzy as Chintzy? I'm sorry, I just Both of your cars are pompous Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish OK how long you wanna me keep saying rubbish? This annoyed the proper men of Pringle who were queuing up behind us.
There is no Roush leather in the Audi, there is no Well, practically, it might as well be Roush.
There're people behind us, they're very angry I know there're people waiting on I'm trying just to get on with it, yeah, I know.
Nope.
After an hour we reached the third hole and were still arguing.
You are completely wrong about the Mazda.
Technically it may be good it may be fantastic on the track, but it's not what's it about on the road.
It's too jigly, - it's too harsh the interior, - Jigly? Just because the Alfa is slightly slower, - You think it must be able to - It's not slightly slower, James.
It's a little bit slower in the real world but in terms of being of the way it feels to drive, the balance, the feel of the steering, the ride, the little niggles you get in it hasn't got a How far can I hit his head? fundament like yours have That's just childish and doesn't solve the argument.
After this, we were asked to leave.
And all we've managed to agree on is that the Alfa was the least golf clubish.
Thank you, thank you obviously we will pick that up later on.
but now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
My guest tonight is a global megastar really, he's made his name playing that kind of dithering English man we all know in love so I guess it's only a matter of time uh before he's asked to play the lead in "James May: the movie".
Please welcome to this poky motoring show, Hugh Grant! - How're you doing - Hi, good to see you.
Very well.
have a seat.
Uh Have a seat.
And um grateful you've come.
I got to say: this is thrill for me.
It's a thrill for me.
No, but it really is, because for the first time ever in the guest interview - we've got girls all around the front.
- Ah yes.
'Cause normally at this point they're all out side talking to Hammond, but now he's out there all by himself.
So let me start off with cars if I may.
Big hollywood star obviously, so I presume you've got a Toyota Prius? You would have thought, you would have thought, um no, I have in my life I've had 2 modes of car, - Little tiny tossers' cars - Uh hum.
And great big [beep.]
cars.
- Um - And you're in which mode now? Do you know, the first time I'm right in between the 2, the tossers' cars began with a a Citroen Dyane and I don't think you can get much tossier than that.
Well the great thing about No the great thing about the Dyane is you could crash it and nobody ever knew 'cause there were so many different angles on it that it was sort of always in Yes, yes, I know what you are saying, also it was you couldn't hurt anyone because it had the power of 4 harnessed children and there is And then you got into the kind of - well you eloquently put it Wankers' cars - Yeah.
Which started with? Well it started with um an Aston Martin Vanquish which was a beautiful car, you want to lick it or mate with it or something, but I never really wanted to drive it very much 'cause the gears did just occasionally, just when you were feeling happy in your car would just seize up, the car would stop, you couldn't even push it to the side of the road, you're just there on the A316 with people going past making wanker signs at you.
A lovely car.
Yeah and then it was Bentley, wasn't it? Then I yeah I did have a Ben I had a footballer's car, Bentley GT Continental um and very nice again, but I've got a bad back and for some reason it manifests itself some times as back pain and some times as bollock pain with the uh with the GT Continental, I got terrible bollock pain some cars seats do it my brother's Golf GTI was the first one hence the syndrome is now known as golf ball.
Um and I got it very badly with the GT Continental so that had to go back after 6 months.
Because of your testicles? Yes, I didn't say that to the um garage.
So um then what after the Bentley was? Then I had a beautiful Porsche which I actually phoned you about.
Yeah, well, actually your girlfriend phoned me up - Yes - And said listen - I've got to get Hugh a car - Yeah a Porsche a Porsche, well that's wrong for a kick-off - but anyway she was adamant it was going to be a Porsche - Yeah And then wanted to know whether it's going to be an automatic or manual gearbox? - Yeah.
- So I said automatic.
Yeah, you're absolutely right and of course I got the manual, and it's so exhuasting - 'Cause you want - All I wanted was a comfy environment And a nice arm chair and for my balls not to hurt, I got it's not asking much for a car.
And the Porsche also has its interesting thing, I think it's fine if the steering wheel's on "ze" left for "ze" Germans - I see, yeah - But on the right for the Brits, something's wrong I think the petrol tank's in the wrong place so you're facing forward like this with your upper body and your lower body is here sort of just looking dile directly left, and I found that tricky.
That is tricky, I once had that in a Lancia Stratus but all annoyingly in the Lancia Stratus all of you face this way while travelling in that which it is really does make it the sensation of speed is tremendous But you'd hit quite often.
Now your driving, how's that? Do you have road rage? Terrible rage, yes, and uh well yeah, it's road rage that then becomes terrible road meekness in a flash in an instant there was this guy who gave me the lightest of knocks, I mean barely touched the car and I went into a complete melt down, um attacked him and when he wouldn't get out of his car, I thought Well I'll attack the car! And I ripped the wind screen wipers right off his car, amazed at my own strength, and he said "You've ripped the wind screen wipers off my car" and immediatelly I said "I'm so sorry.
" "maybe if I " I tried to put them back on, I said "I'll drive you to a garage" Pathetic if you're gonna be angry you know, follow it through.
I once told um someone who is staying who had a dog in the hotel next to um where I was staying that kept barking 5 o'clock in the morning, I got up and then hadn't planned, this is always the play, if you don't plan what you're going to say - all goes wrong - Yeah.
I got out not sure quite what I was going to say, so I went "I've killed before!" My wife was going "What have you killed before?" Anyway, that's Let's talk about films, if we may.
- Your new film - Yeah.
Ok, is you and Drew Barrymore - Yes, sir - And it's called? - It's called "Music and Lyrics" - "Music and Lyrics" Now, I'm sorry about this, we we never normally do plugging on the show, - so I'm not very good at it.
We'll try, - OK have you got any clips here? That doesn't work, does it? We do have a clip, let me just explain what it is, um, I play this ex-80s pop star, fallen on hard times, I get this new contract to write a song for a very famous singer like it might be Britney Spears, I write music, I can't find anyone to write lyrics until I come across this girl who sometimes waters my plants, Drew Barrymore.
And we write this song together and then the clip we see here we're just making a little demo tape.
It sounds so good, I can't believe it.
And now vocals no, no you see, you have to sing into the microphone, it won't follow you.
But I can't.
It's it's a duet for a man and a woman, we are as close as we've got, your head phones and a level, you look nice in those, you should wear them all the time, How is that? Yes? - Ok.
- Shh Shh Shh It's ok And "Way Back Into Love", take one.
Oh, oh God, I'm getting really nervous.
You'll be fine, you'll just use your normal nice voice that I've heard so much of in the last 3 days.
It's like my throat's closing up, it's like anaphylactic It's fine, just a 3 minute song (SINGING)"I've been living with the shadow overhead," (SINGING)"I've been sleeping with the " Just uh a little bit louder 'cause this song is intended for humans ok? Very good.
Do you think? It's a romantic comedy, Jeremy, which is something I've never done before, so um I'd like to stretch myself as an actor, it's all about discovery, isn't it? Reacting, trying new stuff.
And it's a um I think a lovely funny film Its open's on um.
.
on the 9th of February.
Em can I just talk ok, you're we're the same age, give or take, I think - It's hard to believe to look at it, isn't it? - Yeah.
Frankly it is, yeah.
Are you starting to fall to pieces yet? - Yes I am, yes I am , Jeremy.
Yes.
- Are you? Uh worst bit for me, is when you're you've wash you've shaved, you're rinsing your face like this, and then you look up into the mirror, I've got a mirror to the side here.
My eyes look up but my face is still pointing down.
- That's - That's how.
And also didn't you have some trouble with your bottom? That was a terrible moment, yeah, that was a really terrible I I funnily enough that was for "golf ball", it was.
I went to see a doctor in Harley Street, and I it was suspicious of him to begin with 'cause he said uh "Very good if you'd just like to sit, pull all your clothes off?" So I I took them all off, and then he interviewed me.
I sat I sat naked as a baby in front of him like this in a in a very expensive big consultation room while he wrote down things about me, kept looking at me and writing all the things down.
And then he said "Right, we're just going to uh do a quick uh prostate examination.
" Bent me over, and I swear to God, stuck his head up my bottom, because when he said "Does that hurt?" it was muffled, it was "Does that hurt?" And it was the worst pain I've ever had in my life.
Ok listen, I really want to get onto your lap, obviously.
- Yes.
- How did it go out there? I thought quite badly, um I like the Stig very much, he was very kind to me um but uh it's not easy, it's not easy Jeremy.
- You don't think so.
- No, I don't.
'cause it's so counter-intuitive, you know? Just when you're thinking: Well now I'm going to die so I'll brake but he says "Flat down with the accelerator!" And uh and the other way around and um I I know I'm gonna be bad.
Who here would like to see Hugh's lap? (Crowd) Yeah! - Let's play the tape, here it goes.
This is you and there you go.
What a car.
- That's - A very unattractive helmet.
Oh, don't change gear, you [beep.]
! - Crikey Moses! - That can not be my best that's quite grown up.
That was very good through there, excellent.
- Oh where are you going now though? Yeah.
- That's Hammerhead - looking smooth and fast - I never mastered the Hammerhead - Is that a penalty? - That's good, no that's good.
Good line through there.
Oh that was a piece of "art" Oh [beep.]
Soon you're gonna cut inside and you won't be swearing.
Is it gonna be fast through here? See? Every time I came wobbling through a turn there was another ex-BBC camera man right in my way.
Did exactly the wrong thing again.
And here we are, last corner - This is very poor - That's going wide that's wow yes! Across the line! Now I um I know it's not good, I know, I feel I feel like I've let anyone everyone down - and including the Stig.
- No, what do you mean? It's only yourself.
So where do you think you've come on the um - on the board? - Ah, I wish I knew.
Who would I really like I wouldn't like to come lower than Michael Gambon.
- Michael Gambon? You've beat him.
- Yeah.
Oh that's good.
In that case, I I quite like to beat you and McGregor.
- Well, you actually did it in 1 minute - Yes.
- Forty - Yes - Seven Point seven - Yes - Oh hello.
- Congratulations! You're right up there.
You're in fact only emm.
.
point one of a second behind the well spoken man.
Yes, yes.
Anyway, so there you are, uh Ah sorry but Jamie Oliver was in the snow, so he moves up, is that right? No he wasn't, it had melted, he did melted snow - He claims it was snow, and we punished him for that - Yes So no, I I think you're better and funnier and much better looking with a smaller tongue.
Ladies and gentlemen, Hugh Grant! Right, now, earlier, we were testing three coupes to decide which one is best.
I really really like this Alfa Romeo Brera.
Clarkson stupidly prefers this new Audi TT and the damn fool Hammond seems to think it should be this Mazda RX-8.
And so far, we have established pretty much nothing.
But now in the second part of the film we drive into Edinburgh and still arguing.
Can you set the sat nav in your car, OK? Err, no, I haven't got sat nav.
Could you do that, Richard? I go by instinct in here.
So it's the driver's car, or the navigator's car.
or the air hostess's in the case of yours Jeremy Think it with a bit of dust on my headlamps, so I will just wash that off.
Yes, I've done that with my headlamp washers.
Have you done that, James? Well I did that earlier with a wet hanky and end of my finger.
But either of you two got a DSG gearbox.
- No.
- No.
Have you got adjustable suspension, either of you? - No.
- No.
But then I fired a torpedo straight into the side of HMS Clarkson.
Jeremy, can I just ask how much of that stuff is standard.
Almost everything really is an optional extra.
How many is that lot cost? Err, the optional extras on this car add up 2000 pounds.
How much? Six (more) thousand pounds.
Six grand? It's actually eight grand but shh It was tit for tat all the way and nobody was going to give in.
The truth of the matter is this the car you really want looks like the Alfa drives like the Mazda and is built like the Audi.
But since that doesn't exist you've got to have the Audi.
Cause it's the best all round of the best compromise and that, that's an end of it.
It wasn't the end though, because coupes are all about looks.
And to find out which of ours was the best looking we've been told to go to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh.
The challenge was simple, if this prestigious gallery was to accept just one of our cars based on styling and love, which would it be? A panel of experts have been assembled to make the choice.
And to help things along, we'd each been given two minutes to argue the artistic merits of our particular car.
But before that, five minutes in the gallery bookshop to bone up our art bit.
Is there anything Japanese at all? Scottish arts You have like a single volume on the artistic influence of Alfa Romeo coupes.
Err, Japanese culture in general maybe like into an oyster.
Opening itself up to repeat the onslaughts from the oyster.
Unfortunately the crash course in the bookshop just confused us even more.
As the experts discovered when James kicked things off.
Em, good afternoon professors.
I'd like to begin by asking the question Can a car be a piece of art.
I'd like to say immediately that I think no.
That's not a piece of art but can we find any art in that piece of design? I'll put it down there.
Can I really argue that the Audi TT was a reaction to the overly complicated ceiling rose of Victorian houses? For example we can see in the lights of the Alfa Romeo here I think the influence of the Scottish colorists, namely Fergusson and Peploe You went to art school, you should be good at this.
Did you go to art school? No, I didn't.
Then you wouldn't know what you do in art school is drink and pursuing women.
All arts I believe should be about two things, truth and beauty.
Now, it's true because it's real.
It's not actually a piece of art.
How do we shut this man up? Do you know what? We've made amphibious cars, we've made a convertible people carrier, I've raced you to Oslo This is the hardest thing I've ever faced.
He's given the impression that he's taken his brush oil, even his calligraphy pen, the impression he has given I think we've probably heard enough, That's alright with you, thank you very much.
I'll I did want to talk about the renaissance and the meaning of truth - and the development of human thought - We could leave that for another day.
These trousers are not Bauhaus.
Hahaha Why we mates look a bit like a monkey? Their brains are big.
Justify why you think your car should be in this gallery.
Um, one can see influences of the Bauhaus thinking in so many of the things around us today, some of the design classic.
Um Mart Stam's cantilever chair and the Marcel Breuer "Wassily" chair.
Why is he talking about chairs? It looks like it's going somewhere, it looks purposeful, I mean if you compare it, for example, that's the inside of the Mazda, that's not Bauhaus.
That's my trousers Woo, look, I found Jeremy's notes, trousers, fat, Hitler, tiger, Mazda, Alfa, modernism, minimalism minimalism, modernism I think it created cubism, I think it created Picasso, no, not that one Cubism came about 10 or 15 year earlier, but go on I don't think that I think the Audi is Bauhaus But I think it's got a very contemporary veneer.
I mean one shouldn't hang the whole item on the Bauhaus, I don't think it's "Das ist einfach nicht wahr" as they would say in the Bauhaus It's just not true.
What does it symbolize? The Audi symbolizes freedom? Freedom! Like that.
(Brave Heart) Warm in there, isn't it? Err, gentlemen, God is the reason why you might look at this car the Mazda RX-8.
And see there's something a bit unusual.
The Mazda is a Japanese car.
In understanding a little bit about why this car is different to ours.
And you can see that express through out Japanese culture and paintings, If you to take We are just gonna see you put your hands in your pocket 'cause you're sort of refering to note here.
I can I can do that.
Em, if you refer to "Catching Catfish with a Gourd", from the 15th century by Josetsu One of the blokes over there is an expert on Japanese and oriental art, you know that Can you just reiterate some of those points? Which point? The ones you just made.
Did you feel a bit thick when you finished doing it? Thick? How do you think he is gonna feel? He'll probably punch one of them I've eaten brighter vegetables than he is.
You put this car in the gallery Yeah What else are you going to have in the environment that surround it? Maybe to extend it further.
.
Maybe to have some other Japanese stuff in there.
Do you have any examples, that you think would be or value for the potential visitors? Some paint.
Japanese paintings.
By anyone particular? That would be for, perhaps, you know, specialists to choose.
How did that go? I think well, I think well, err Do you know you're bright red.
Yeah, I'm hot, very hot.
The boffins conferred and then called us all in to give their verdicts.
I think the Audi is err you know sort of constrained, it's modest, it's sort of tidy.
But it's not saying, doesn't say very much to me.
You know, this lessness is less for me not more.
Err, I'm most persuaded by the Alfa.
I agree entirely, yes.
The Mazda, I looked at it from various angles.
And it just doesn't seem to be as clear cut as an expression of what the modern art motif coupe is.
And I think that's the Alfa.
In terms of the look, the style, everything that it denotes we'd be happy to show that car in this gallery, the Alfa Romeo.
Well it's alright.
- / - Cause it'll just break down before it got here.
- / - You get oil all over your nice floor.
Come on, you can stop being petty and infantile.
These three men are experts in art and artistic expression - Well, they are wrong.
- It's only 'cause I've said freedom.
That's what we Well, rubbish.
As Richard said: They were wrong.
So now we're gonna do a much more important test which is the fastest around our track? Now obviously to find that out, we have to hand them over to our tame racing driver.
Some say that he once had a vicious knife fight with Anthea Turner and that he is in no way implicated in the "Cash for Honours' Scandal" All we know is, he's called Lord Stig.
Well that has wasted about an hour with wheel spin.
Get off, he started off in the best car.
The only proper sports car, of course the Mazda.
Rear wheel drive of course, this is familiar to him, it feels like a sports car 'cause it was designed as a sports car.
Radio: Lucy looked at him, the strong, kind face and the endearing look in his eyes, and she opened her heart to him.
Now you see, this romantic fiction, he's into it now.
Right over oh look at that, you see, - it's so controllable, you can steer it with the rear end.
- Is it moving? Is it moving? Rubbish, it's fast, mate.
Don't ignore.
Here we go , hammerhead.
- Oh - Look at that.
No, no, that's miles off.
That is elegant and controlled.
That really is.
He'll be enjoying that in there, - that's familiar territory for him.
- 40? And it looks at home on the track unlike the other two.
He'll have to lift off then.
- It's not for Oh, look at that.
- 45 - Braking, oh he'll be around here in a minute.
- Now he's got 1 corner and the final corner, - under control and looking like a proper fast car - Look at chintzy styling - He's lost it, that's all very bad.
- Oh, what a spectacle.
Still there, No, good front end grip, good balance, excellent brakes, Oh ho ho, did you see that dive? Wow, it's like watching the actual studio going around, isn't it? -That's balance and poise.
- It's boring.
I suppose you're gonna tell us it's the most practical car, James? Well actually it is, you see.
Because you can get 2 people in the front, I checked that.
Oh very useful.
And it goes off the road You know it's no good for golf 'cause it's the least Pringly and now you're telling this's got golf rackets in it.
- Look at that - It's It's not turned at all there, it understeered Look at this, really, IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ve never seen a car oversteer He's using all the track, - that's what - He needs all the track, that's different.
It hasn't let no, here we go, it'll just crash now, no, that was Beautiful.
Here we go, he's understeered - well, no he's got it in yes -Very neat, clip the apex.
- And here - Steering accurately - Out of control We got oil coming out of the bottom, right, gentlemen, behold the magnificent.
Oh you're off to the hair dresser, sir? - Get off! - Hahaha.
Oh would you like any bred items? I know you're thinking this is the old TT, don't muddle them up, that was for air hostesses, people who are orange.
This is the new one, it's a completely different animal, this remember it's only the front wheel drive one, the baby one, look at it.
Front wheel drive, unlike a sports car, which would have rear wheel drive.
Oh you just saw the back coming round there, - it's got a little bit of left off over steer.
- A little bit I saw it, I saw the front nod.
Here we go, just watch this, look at this, compare to your one James? - It's worse.
- Boy, that was so slow! It's not worse.
It is worse, look, it's on the grass, it's almost on the grass.
The right honestly, this is a completely different animal than the one we used to have.
- This is fast.
Yes.
- No.
Only the 2 Liter one, remember? - Just the baby.
- Miles out.
The V6 actually is nowhere near as good as this.
As we come up to the final corner.
It's going to under steer off and crash.
Oh, it's done it, it's off the road.
It's just airborne.
Right, ready? Time for the Audi I wouldn't I wouldn't be so confident, because you see my car, I think on a race track, you'll find that Hahaha, five seconds.
Listen, you can stop being quite so cocky about it because your Audi hasn't won anything yet.
Remember how it's been? It's not the best looking, it's the most expensive.
It's not the most practical.
Exactly and we're about to find out that it isn't the fastest either when my Mazda beats it.
Hah! Oh Damn No, no, no you've won.
I've lost.
No 'cause I'm gonna own up now.
Secretly all along IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ve preferred the Alfa.
What? No, I just know, I seriously, I just if it were my money, that's what IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½d buy, and IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ll bet you any money it's the same for you.
Yeah.
Yes, I knew it, I knew it.
But, I'm sorry before you get too cocky, I would not recommend one to a friend.
That's the thing, 'cause you well you wouldn't, you can't say Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Yes, go and buy an Alfa" 'Cause then they'll spend the rest of their life in a car that just stays on the side of the motorway.
So I can't recommend one to a friend.
Could you? No, I wouldn't recommend one, no.
- E E would you? - Come on.
No, alright.
There you are, you see? You wouldn't.
So what we've managed to establish is the best car here is the worst! Yeah, wow we're good at this.
We are.
And that's the end of the show, thank you very much for watching, next week we've got a top gear special see you then, good night.

<|endoftext|>

Thank you, Thank you! Hello and Welcome to what is, tonight, a Top Gear special.
It's special because it is just one big film.
Yep.
And to make it, we had to go on holiday.
Well you say it was a holiday, but actually it was a fly-drive holiday, so it wasn't a holiday at all.
Because of course you get to the car hire desk, and there is the gaudiness man with spiky hair.
And he types "War and Peace" into his computer for 16 hours.
And then he doesn't know where England is.
And he steals your driving license.
And that he directs you to a car park where your car isn't.
So we're all gonna try and see if we could make it any better.
Rather than suffer the misery of hiring a car, maybe it made more sense to buy one.
We were each given the budget of 1000 dollars.
Yeah, now here is the really clever bit.
At the end of our holiday, which is essentially a road trip across 4 states, we would see if, instead of simply having to hand our hired car back, we can sell our cars and get most of the thousand dollars back.
It's brilliant.
Now, in the holiday we had stones thrown at us by rednecks.
We crashed into a river full of alligators.
What else happened? We had to eat a squirrel.
Ah, anyway, the big challenge was: could we buy a car for less than it costs to rent one for a fortnight? Let's find out.
Miami, cloudy sunny, 34 degrees.
Yes, Miami, home to all the most successful drug dealers, this year's Mr.
Big Mac, and Silicon Valley, all very glamorous.
But our journey began here: in the city's used-car lots.
This is where we had a morning to find a set of wheels for less than a thousand dollars.
I think I quite like to take this one for a test drive.
What's under the bonnet of that? - It's a V6.
- V6? - Yes.
- Got anything with a V8? I wanted a muscle car.
So I went straight to a dealership that sells Corvettes.
You got the keys? Thank you.
Oh - 400.
- 400 horse power for a 5.
7 liter V8? Ah Ok, how much is it? si sixty four? - thousand dollars? - Yeah.
What if I gave you 1 thousand dollars for it? - One thousand? - Ehm Richard it seems was being similarly ambitious.
- How much is this? - $89,900 I need something a bit, a bit less than that.
- A little bit less than that? - Less than that.
So how much for a Cougar? Cougars are anywhere from $35,000 to $200,000.
Depending upon the condition and so on.
I need something that's a bit less than that.
- Less than that? - How much for a Challenger? Challenger start at $20,000--$19,900.
Less than that.
- Less than that? - Less than that.
You see this, here, look, he is turning right on the red light.
That's America's only contribution to Western civilization.
(Radio) I was the only one using even a modicum of common sense.
Would you take a thousand for this.
OK, Err.
That's gonna be a little bit difficult.
Soon I took a leaf out of James's book.
Lowered my sights and quickly found a tidy Camaro at a place called "Adolf's" $2,900 this.
It's a big ask to get him down to 1000.
May I offer him a burger? Very popular with murderers these cars.
Yeah.
Meanwhile, I found something we don't have in Britain.
A dealership specializing in ex-government cars.
This would have been the police car.
You can tell it by the colour, a hole for the aerial.
And it says "police interceptor" on it.
Now this one was probably, I don't know, maybe a spy? 'Cos there is no badge on there.
That could have been a man in black and that was a vet manner.
Basically the important thing is: They've all been properly maintained and I'm told that they are dirt cheap.
And indeed they were.
But even these were beyond my budget.
I don't have anything right now for a 1000 dollars.
Even sensible James was struggling.
I want a real cold jack, smoking.
- Ah real cool car hum? - Yeah.
How about a '99 Honda Civic? Meanwhile, back at Adolf's, negotiations on the Camaro had broken down.
Eh, well, it's not going well, mate.
I thought that we'd get here and we'd find all sort of fantastic old American 80's cars for 300 dollars I know, I did, I did.
I thought we would just be tripping over Oldsmobiles, Cutlasses and Firebirds.
So it's coz that we are buying that 90's period when they were just making rubbish.
And I'm looking at a Buick Le Sabre.
- Oh, God, don't.
- It was rubbish when it was new.
It was built by idiots.
And it's rubbish now.
I've got You know we've got one hour left.
And I've reached the bottom end of this town.
Yeah, I wouldn't have the Chinese food round here.
Let's put it that way.
The fact was though, if we were gonna find cars for $1,000, we'd have to go to a even lower bottom end of the town.
How much murdering happens here? A lot.
If you go one mile away here, you go to any street.
- I'll be murdered.
- You'll find yourself killed Yeah.
Everybody here, they have guns.
Including me, wanna see it? - He is not joking! - It's real, here.
25.
Now you see I wasn't ready for that.
Welcome to United State.
This is his other gun.
That's not a shot gun, Robert.
That's a rifle.
Right it's a rifle.
The shot gun is somewhere else.
I don't know where it that one.
You need these if you're gonna be a car sellsman.
A guy right here if you go two blocks down here.
He got shot five times.
Why? By someone buying the car? But he killed the guy.
He killed a He killed the guy finally.
So why have you got telescopic sights on it? Because if they go far away, you just shoot them.
You saw that movie with John Wayne? A guy running all the way like 500 feet and 'Pooosh' you shoot him right there.
- Hammond.
- Yes? Jeremy how are you doing? Just been told by my new best friend, Robert the Persian.
if you go beyond 79 street, you will definitely be murdered, shot.
Good-bye.
Hammond is wearing cowboy boots, They're gonna shoot him, aren't they? Is it south or north of 79 street I can't go? I decided the best plan was to stay on 79 street itself.
And came across what must be the most optimistic dealer in town.
Very well, these must.
The lesson we've learned already was that it was easier to rent a car than buy one.
But we weren't giving up.
Believe me, I'm desperate now.
I'm desperate for wheels.
Distressed look on the roof, gun shot holes.
So car's got a history.
It's messedÂ¡Â­oh, no.
It's got tree growing out of it.
There's been an accident over there, but the car's still running.
And I was just wondering if I could make an offer for it.
We've been ambitious here I think.
This $1000 is a low amount of money.
I therefore decided to go beyond the lower back end of town.
You guys got any ideas where I can find a car for a thousand dollars? A thousand dollars? Kind of cunning.
You've got some great teeth You see these teeth! Haha - You want it today? - It's got to be today.
OK.
Alright, let me get back to you.
Go right here to the stop front.
Go to right, go over exactly two blocks - Over this way? - Yeah.
Amazingly the tip paid off.
And I was the first to arrive at our pre-arranged meeting point.
the Miami Jai-Alai Stadium This is a Chevrolet Camaro, the RS model.
a full-on American muscle car.
Only three previous murderers and I only paid 800 dollars for it.
I am It's a brilliant, brilliant, brilliant find.
Then Hammond turned up.
Oh, dear.
He's never been to America before and now he's bought himself what he thinks all the Americans have.
That is bluff.
- What do you think? - I'm /, well.
- It's a Dodge Ram.
- It's terrible.
A dent? I know, there are a few dents and a bit's missing.
But it's basic.
It's basic motoring in its very best.
You know how Mercedes goes? It's not a Mercedes.
It's not a Mercedes.
- How much? - A thousand.
That shuts.
A thousand? 800.
I'm already 200 dollars ahead of you.
The RS model.
Was that the basic one? Of course it wasn't the basic one.
RS is rally sport.
I'd ask James on that one when he arrives.
But I'm not entirely sure it was.
It was the RS, the IROC-Z.
The RS was the yes Yes the queerest.
I'll keep quiet about it.
Every single thing on it works, nearly.
It's a manual.
Yeah, five on the floor, rear wheel drive, I've got a muscle car.
How many horse power? - 200 and 170.
- Oh, rubbish.
190.
How do they get such a small amount of horse power from a car? The more pressing question though was where was James? When he walks into a dealership, 'Hello', and they will shoot him.
Hahaha How can it take so long? Because that's what he does.
And he may have been lost.
Good Grief! That's Tinanic.
No, wait, I changed my mind.
It's an aircraft carrier.
That's really big.
That, gentlemen, is how you do it.
It's a 1989 Cadillac Brougham sedan.
What do you think? Well, this is terrible.
It's like a long walk round it.
It's a really long walk.
- I like that though.
- It doesn't just move up and down, look.
It goes from side to side.
Have you seen the roads around here? That is a perfect car for the environment.
900 dollars.
And you can see why.
Oh look, well you don't do that, mate.
Oh it's got newspaper in it.
You can date it, find out when it was repaired.
It was a Wednesday.
What size engine does this thing got? You don't say it's not fast.
Is it not, mate? I'll tell you when you look at the Oh it's like a Lotus Exige.
James then turned on our cars.
- The wheels are odd.
- No I've got an alloy.
That's my alloy.
Check out my alloy.
This just has been made out of bits.
It hasn't.
Have you? Ah Smells of bodies.
Oh, it does smell a bit ripe.
Hold on.
This is Er.
No, that's the clothes of the last person they killed.
Oh, Jeez.
Oh my.
Oh God, no.
That's the last person the driver killed.
Don't look.
Poor man, tried to get out.
- James and I bought cars.
- Yes You've bought a pick-up truck.
Now the reason that yours is in better condition is because it's just a pick-up truck.
It's lovely.
I'm delighted with it.
I quite like the pick-up truck.
- Oh, come on.
Compared to the Camaro - It's the land of the pick-up truck.
- What you don't like the Camaro? - I don't.
I'm sorry I don't.
Well, I do.
I mean, one of those in good nick.
Yes.
Yours is a dog.
- It isn't.
- It is Jeremy.
But every one of us has got something better than you get from a rental desk in an airport.
- Oh, Yeah.
- Oh, Yeah.
To find out how good our cars were.
We were told to head to a race track.
There we'll be given a seris of challenges.
I'm in a murderer's muscle car, heading through Miami.
Yes This is brilliant.
I love pick-up trucks.
It's a Cadillac.
I'm absolutely staggered.
I've even got a functioning radio.
Although there is only one station it'll pick up, which is gospel.
Ready? (Radio) the people of the holy spirit, - Yes (Radio) - Jesus Christ is my lord - Yes I agree with you.
(Radio) Temperatures very high today, we're well into the 90s, near 100.
The mono radio staion however was the tip of an iceberg.
If I'm honest, there are one or two issues with my Camaro.
Ah the rev counter for example, broken.
Then there is an alarming knocking noise from the front suspension when it goes over a bump, or when you are on full lock.
The others too, were finding problems.
Now we're alone you and I, I've got to admit to one or two very small faults with my Cadillac.
First is that squeak, which is a loose belt or a belt ring or something.
The other, it is fantastically slow this thing.
I'm doing 55 and I'm putting my foot down.
And I'm really struggling to get it up to 60 If I'm honest, it does pull a little bit to the right.
And if I brake, it pulls to the left really badly.
I'm right behind Richard Hammond's Dodge Ram, but I just noticed for the first time that the body doesn't line up with the wheels quite right.
But the worst problem by a mile is the air-conditioning, which, as you can probably see from the state of my shirt, is broken The only consolation I have is that Hammond's air-conditioning doesn't work either.
Apart from the air-conditioning not working, it's pretty much perfect.
For the first time I've got a radio on one of these trips.
But enough of the car's little foibles.
It was time to settle down and enjoy our journey across the Sunshine State.
God, Florida's awful! Nasty insects, old people, fat people, a lot of people who all offer you cheese: 'you want cheese with that? You want cheese with that'? And they'll shoot you.
While Hammond roasted, James remained smug and cool.
It's get a bit of parky actually.
I think I'll just turn the temperature up very slightly.
Look, I'm Burt Reynolds, I'm the Bandit.
Eventually, we turned off the high way.
And arrived at the race track.
The Moroso Motorsports Park is unusual in the America.
Because it has left-handed turns, and some which go right as well.
Perhaps that's why it was deserted: too complicated for the colonials.
Or maybe everyone had been murdered.
Whatever.
It was time for our first challenge.
It says here that each of our cars must complete one lap of the track.
The target is 1 minute 10 seconds Get points for every second under that time, and you lose points for every second over it.
Yeah, but the thing is none of us has ever seen that track.
Yes, that's gonna be tricky.
- We're not driving.
- Well who is? Some say that he's a C.
I.
A.
experiment that went wrong, and that he only eats cheese.
All we know is, he's not the Stig.
But he is the Stig's American cousin! Woo! - Big Stig! - Hahaha First, he squeezed himself into my Camaro.
One, Two, Three, Go! Hahaha I was expecting: 'Rarara ' - Nought to 60 in 7.
9 seconds.
- Yeah, once.
- Can do 110 and he is doing that now! - And no more.
- It's limited.
It's electronically limited.
- No.
It's just naturally limited to 110 'cos it's rubbish.
Lean that weight in there Big Stig.
Here it goes.
1 minutes 9 seconds on our Top Stopwatch.
- Is that good? - We don't know, do we? What we did know was that the Pipmobile was next.
- I'm gonna need a calendar for this.
Not a stopwatch.
- Yeah.
- You got a diary? - I might I'm gonna hold this stone and as it's eroded by the wind That'll give us an idea of how long he has been.
Air-con, max.
Oh, cock.
Hahaha - It's broken, isn't it? - It's run out of electricity.
To raise the Titanic, we borrowed a battery booster.
Is that for starting your watch while it stopped.
- Oh, it's begun.
- Oh, it's very good.
One, Two, Three, go! - Hahaha - It's moved off.
It's still moving off.
I'm getting older.
Hey, look, it's fabulous.
Come on, admit it.
Well, we've got plenty of time to admire it.
The Cadillac certainly seemed to suit Big Stig's relaxed driving style.
- Hahaha - On the grass! But would the match made in Heaven be able to beat the Camaro's 1:09? Yeah! - Go on.
- One minute fourteen.
So now it's all down to Hammond's hillbilly-mobile.
- One, two, three, go! - Let it rock, Yeah! Oh, nice.
Haha.
- Is that manual? - It sounds very Yeah.
Stick shift, four on the floor with overdrive.
Actually it all looked pretty promising.
This beats mine I'm gonna have to kill you.
And I am in a Camaro, so don't think that won't happen.
Oh, it's a proud and noble thing.
You've seen Brokeback Mountain and thought: 'I want a piece of that life.
' Not that piece, I'll have the pick-up truck.
Although the truck had started well, in the last few tight corners it was rubbish.
Have you seen that my alloy dancing in the sun.
- Where were you? 1:14? - Yeah.
- 12:13, 1:14, Yes! - No it can't be No! - How can that happen? - 1:16.
9.
I think that's more to do with the Stig being too big to get He didn't make the turn.
Fat Stig's work was done.
And so it was time for the next challenge.
You must each accelerate your car to 50 mph, when you reach 50 mph you must brake as hard as you can.
So this is a test of acceleration and braking all together? Yes, you must brake before the end of the track.
At the end of the track, there is a river That's no big deal.
full of alligators.
And that wasn't a missprint.
I should explain.
That is the track.
So if you look out there, OK? There it is.
OK? And here, this is alligator infested.
There's another one.
We drew hot dogs, and mine was the shortest.
I hope he doesn't die at the end.
It's salt-water crocodiles you need to worry about, I think.
Oh, no.
I hope he doesn't go in the river.
That'd be awful.
Here we go, the hell with the clucks.
Spirited start.
Come on.
30, I don't wanna be eaten by an alligator.
- That's doubly disappointing.
No.
1, he is not dead.
- Yeah.
And No.
2 the fastest accelerating car here only just stopped before the grass.
Surely though, the Huggy Bear-mobile would struggle to do 0 to 50 to 0 in the distance.
- That is movement.
- Oh, come on car! Come on, come on, come on, I'm nearly there! Break! Strewth, I'm worried.
I should imagine he's clenched in there I was really nervious.
I'd just seen Big Stig try to stop my truck, and fail completely.
We're away, 20 Here he comes to a certain death! Oh, my God.
- God - Oh, my.
Haha That is quite funny.
- Hammond, alligators, mate.
- Are you alive? Yeah, I suggest we may have made them angry.
We have just driven in theirhahaha into the living room.
Such an insufferarable oaf.
Oh, there is my pickup, look! The cars had survived their ordeal by track, just.
But the next morning, the real test began.
A sweltering 800-mile road trip to New Orleans.
Today, probably cloudy, high sun all over 90's, chance of thunderstorms 30% Things started badly.
- Has it got petrol in it? - Yeah, look it's full.
Well, yeah, but has it got petrol in it? It could be broken.
- When did you last put petrol in it? - Erm Miami.
- Now you come to mention it.
- You stupid man.
It's a 5 liter V8! See you then.
The car was fine.
What's happened is Hahaha.
Mine ran out of electricity again.
You're joking.
Can I borrow your van and your jump leads? See how prepared we are on this sh show.
You have the err.
.
leads in your car.
No, no, you have the leads.
I'm not stupid, man!? I've got a door panel, some bolts, and that's it.
What's the matter? - He's lost the Jump Leads - He's lost the Jump Leads, HE has lost the Jump Leads This isn't going well is it? If you're thinking of coming to America this is what it's like: you got your Comfort Inn; you got your Best Western; you got your Red Lobster where you eat.
Everybody's very fat, everybody's very stupid and everybody's very rude.
It's not the Holiday programme - it's the truth.
Eventually the leads were found and Hammond positioned himself for the jump start.
- No it's not funny.
- Hahaha We're off! I'm sweating already.
Yes, I'm not going be to for much longer.
It's not a sunny day, It's just a humid day this day.
You know what this is? Tropical.
No, that's the approach of a cold front.
That's tall cumulonimbus with a high It's bigger than you expect.
You don't feel like I'd love to know what Hammond thinks he looks like.
Chewing gum, his aviators, his cowboy hat, his pickup truck.
To help relieve the tedium of the journey, the production office had provided us with C.
B.
Radios And for those, we needed appropriate call signs Brokeback, Brokeback, this is Murderer.
This is Brokeback, to Murderer and Captain that !@#$%^& No wonder these C.
B.
Radios never caught on.
Break break one nine contact eye ball ten ten, should we do it again? Captain Slow.
!@#$%^& There, he is there and I can't understand him.
This was hopeless.
So we changed channals.
Hello, I'm on 22, are you there? - Yooo, big boy! - Hahaha And finally made contact with a native.
That's him in that truck! He is asking He's asking another lorry driver where he might find a lady friend for the afternoon.
All they've got to talk about on that C.
B.
is the weather, and prostitutes.
Yeah, It's raining, ah, I'm going north, and I'm looking for a whore.
As we headed northwest, the heat and humidity became unbearable.
You are sitting there, in the winter, you can't imagine what it's like to be in a non-airconditioned car in Florida now.
It's so hot! (Radio) Danger persists in the hot West.
(Radio) Even if almost a quarter of the fire is contained, much of it is still burning out of control.
Only the insufferable May wasn't suffering.
Chaps it's May here, just to let you know that my air-conditioning is working very nicely.
it's 69 degrees Fahrenheit Yes, alright.
But then the smile was wiped from his face, again.
I brought you some presents.
I've got you steak and cheese biscuit.
What? - I bought you a fan.
- really? - Yeah, we've got fans.
How do you feel now? - That's fantastic, mate.
Yeah, air-con, there it is.
See what I've got.
- Harman cheese? - Yeah.
Dandy Harman Cheese, original ingredients, blablabla And, imitation American cheese.
So is there anything that hasn't actually got any cheese on this? After our imitation American lunch, it was my turn to help restart the Cadillac.
Oh, yes! Oh I'm back in the sweat box.
Now what that is doing is just turbo charging warm air into my face.
Nice bit.
Jeremy, this is Brokeback, did you cut the wire? (Radio) You want your man to look good, but words like 'ex-foliant' scare him? The miles passed with the Cadillac endlessly breaking down.
- Have you got the leads? - No, you've got the leads.
(Radio) on my first qualify while it sounds a little modest Still, thanks to the automatic windscreen washers at Florida Service Stations No, no! Hammond and I could at least enjoy some refreshing showers, while he got it going again.
The Cadillac, however, was not the only trouble maker.
After just 200 miles my Camaro was hardly tiptop, either.
Right, sit-rep on the Camaro, some of the headlights are working, the dashboard's come off, all the dials are broken, one radio speaker remains, however, and it's good! (radio) Good news is that with God's help we can stop Global Warming.
(Radio) In a world where the tails stop wagging, sticks don't get fetched and chew toys stay dry, (Radio) one man dares to step forward and declare: (Radio) I can get to the root of your dog's depression.
Eventually, our Top Gear fly-drive holiday convoy reached the 300 mile mark.
And as a reward, the production office gave each of us $100 to buy an accessory that might in some way make our journey less arduous.
Hoping and praying that James had bought a new battery for his stupid Cadillac, We all met up to show off our new toys.
A trailer? No, a Freedom Grill 500.
A grilling system? - It's a grilling system.
- What is it? - I have beenno way! - No.
Look at that.
Drop tail gate, cooking platform, what do you think? Gordon Ramsey hasn't got anything like that in his kitchen.
You got anything that good James? No.
Right, I got a clothes rack.
- What? - Look at my perfectly pressed linen jacket.
- He has a linen jacket on the clothes - He has got - Don't wobble it.
Ok, you step into your car.
And here if you look, is a shower.
- In your car? - Yeah.
Where do you get the water from then? It comes from the cool box in the back, it's tuned.
And then you just plug this into the cigarette lighter, hit that button, refreshing shower.
I bet you're all jealous.
Sadly though our dreams of luxury living were shattered when we received the next challenge Tonight, you will be camping.
- What? - I know.
And you're only allowed to eat what you find dead at the side of the road.
What? You mean road kill? Yeah, you're only allowedit's on the yeah.
It says animals that we find by the side of the road, dead.
Yeah, that's our supper.
Hey, just think about it: you can prepare the food, like for cooking wash it.
I can then cook it.
James can dress for dinner.
these potatos, tomatos, it's lightened up.
I can see that, so let me ask you, how high should a pineapple bounce when it's ripe? OK, sit-rep, the power steering pump really is on its last legs, I've got a terrible wheel wobble.
Er but I'm cool for the first time since I set off.
I am cool now! To increase our chances of finding some road kill, we swapped the interstate for smaller roads.
And very quickly, we got lucky.
On the right, what's that? You know what, I I don't fancy it.
No matter though, because further down the road I came across a fresh and tasty possum.
But then James don't ran over it you stupid! You blithering idiot, you just ran over it.
That's not edible now, is it? For flattening our supper, James was punished.
Eventually, we did find fresh meat, but it was a bit too fresh.
- I thought you were gonna run it over.
- No, even I wouldn't do that.
ErrrDon't do that tortoise.
How can you have wildthere is no wild tortoises.
Well, they're gonna be somewhere.
He's escaped from some eight-year-old girl and How does a tortoise escape? Come back, come back! Finally though, 10 miles down the road.
We've got dinner! - Squirrel.
- Check that out! I think that with a bit of cheese will be delicious.
I never told you about my vegetarianism, did I? Soon, we were near the field where we would be camping for the night.
Right now.
Sun's going down, with my mates, it's down below 90 degrees, we're in the deep south, it's a pleasant evening.
This is nice.
But we still only had a squirrel for dinner, so I peeled off for one last forage while the others went ahead to set up camp.
Sorry.
Right, we've got work to do.
Begin, squirrel on the rack, and then maybe here is my plan: with a few herbs, garnished, something like that.
Em I'm thinking if I cook it once, and then maybe cook it again, so it'll go like crispy duck, only it's a squirrel.
Is he ever coming back? We can't just lob it on, can we? OK, when with a rabbit, you take the head off, you go down the middle.
But all we've got to do with is this tent pick - Didn't you bring a penknife? - No.
Time passed and still no sign of Jeremy.
I'm not peeling it, mate.
I don't see why I should do it.
- Come on.
- I don't want to peel a squirrel.
- I'm gonna bring a squirrel over to you.
- Is that a car? Is it Jezza? James, in all seriousness, That's what?! You have got to be It's a flaming cow, mate.
- Main course.
- Yeah.
I'm thinking how long have I've been in the sun putting the tent up.
- Why? - Because, what I'm seeing, heha, you'll love it.
Is a cow on the roof of your Camaro.
It is, isn't it? That is a cow on there.
I don't want to be pedantic, but is it a road kill? Well you're suggesting I ran it down? - Well - Check out the front of my car.
I had to find someone to help me getting it on there.
But I didn't ran it down.
It was at the side of the road, and now it's on the roof, and now it's our supper.
Do you know what to do with it? Well, we gotta Peel it.
I'm not peeling that.
First though, we had to get it off the roof.
What if I go round a corner quite quickly, backwards? - If I reverse.
- Em Left hand down, yeah.
Left hand down, it'll roll over that way, do we think? I reckon it's just good to go.
Yes, there you go! - Hey, Jeremy.
- What? I'm better, I can't see a cow on the roof of your Camaro anymore.
- I've done.
- I'm not hungry.
- What? - I'm not hungry.
You son It stinks, Jeremy.
That night, Brokeback and I feasted on beef and squirrel.
And then with May in bed, we decided it would be better for all of us if the air-conditioning in his car were to break.
- Shh - OK.
Sorry.
Why don't we just hit it with a hammer? Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on.
They really built it on buses.
It's ridiculous! That's come off.
Hehehe I'm just hitting it with a spatula.
Another mosquito's bit my face.
It's not working, isn't? He is gonna notice, isn't he? Another humid day dawned and now May knew what it felt like.
Those pathetic, lager swilling, barbequing, redneck thugs that I call my co-presenters have vandalised my car.
I have had to make a few modifications to car on this morning, because of the cow incident I lost the aerial.
So now I've got an i-station instead.
And that teemed with a fan means I really can't see where I'm going.
Also, because some cow did get into the car, I'm using air fresheners to cover up the smell So I can't really see where I've been.
Oh, and the passenger seat, I've got lots of cow juice on it, so it's now at the back of Hammond's truck.
(radio) At this afternoon, skys will be considerably cloudy, with showers and thunderstorms likely.
Northeast winds, 5 to 10 miles per hour.
Come on.
Alabama's only 40 miles now.
Our scrapyard cars had covered 650 miles and inevitably they were becoming more than just metal.
This whole thing now really sums up why I love cars.
Now you take this Camaro, the dash is more plastic than an American newsreader, the engine's got less power than Belgium, the suspension is softer than journalism in an in-flight magazine, and of course it reeks of cow.
But, I adore it.
because you can just sense it wants to keep going.
And I bet James is exactly the same there in the Cadillac.
I bet he is having exactly the same emotions.
I'd rather be in this now than an Enzo.
And I'm not joking.
But before we entered Alabama, we have to go to Bagdad for our next challenge.
This is it.
We're in Bagdad.
Not a place I was expecting to visit on this trip.
Challenge time.
Lose 5 pounds in 1 hour.
Yep, sweat it away.
Come on then.
No.
OK.
It says here we must not be shot or arrested as we drive across the proud state of Alabama.
But we will get bonus points if we can get one of the others shot or arrested.
I don't understand.
How do we do that? You will therefore decorate one another's cars in such a way to draw maximum attention to yourself in this Bible-bashing, redneck, deeply Christian part of the Union.
Decorate? I think what it means is we each have to write slogans on the other one's car, so you to get them killed? - Yeah, so - Alright? You do Hammond's.
Take it away into the bushes.
You do I'll do yours, I'm getting you killed.
- I've got an idea.
- Well, come on.
The south, the south.
It is Christian, short hair, they don't like Communists.
What is closest to their heart.
I gotta get him killed.
This is once-in-a-life oppotunity.
I (won't) be letting you down, me down, everybody down.
Revenge for all those height cacks.
Every time he's called me Hamster.
This is for every time you've been late and lost.
Can you tell what it says yet? James, I hate you for that.
I really hate you for that.
All the time you drove into the back of my Cadillac.
Do you know, actually, I think honestly we've all done a good job here but I do believe that the person most likely to be shot is indeed Hammond.
- I think the thing done there James is killed your friend.
- Yeah.
Gingerly, we rejoined the open road.
George Bush, God, Country and Western.
In that order, ascending order.
'Country and western is rubbish' 'Hillary for president' I'll be honest.
I have felt less conspicuous than this.
'Man-love rules OK' Here we are.
Sweet home Alabama.
They've shot their own sign.
What are they gonna do to us.
To understand what Jeremy's actually done to my car, You have to remember that this is deep Republican territory.
That woman is the arch Democrat.
She is the anti-Christ.
It's not just the slogan, It's the fact that it's painted on a pickup, symbol of the South, I mean And then Jeremy's written on the boot: NASCAR sucks.
That's a type of saloon car racing that is very very big in this part of the world.
This is where all the drivers come from, All the building of the cars is done.
All the supporters come from down here.
To say it sucks is a bit like going up and punching somebody's sainted mother.
We've survived the highway but then we had to pull into a town for fuel.
Oh, this is really terrifying.
OK.
Just, that's diesel.
Listen, listenThe / president.
Tha.
.
That's not going down well.
This lady was cross.
But not as cross as the garage's owner.
I'll ask you! Now are you all gay, hooking to see I want it takes your beat up in a hick town? I'm not gay.
I'm married.
I've got three children.
No, we are not.
No.
We just sort of decorated ours cars in a distinctive manner.
NASCAR sucks.
Country and western is rubbish.
Guess what you are on a hick town, man.
We are gonna die now.
- That's it.
- Don't you dare She said she was gonna get the boys.
So we decided to scarper.
I've just remembered I've actually got loads of petrol.
And then, of all the moments, - Oy, Jump leads.
- You're joking.
- Jump leads.
- Not now! This is gonna be the quickest jump in history.
Very well, you get the leads I'll start it.
Tell your friend to reject off my parking, I'm getting more people.
The rednecks arrived.
We just got a slight problem here.
This is bad.
Then they turned on the film crews.
Rocks started pelting our vans.
Go! Get out of here! What's happening? For the next few moments our TV program became a radio showing.
They're with pick-up trucks.
Can you put your foot down, I think we've got a load of them on our tail.
Something is going on here.
I'm telling you because these strange trucks that were in the petrol station have now just torn past us.
We need to get these slogans all flushed.
Pull over, pull over.
Get the other side Got anything to wipe it off with now? - There.
- Got it! With the artwork gone, we hit the road, hard.
Now I'm doing something I never thought I do.
I'm running for the border.
God, I never know that was actually frightening.
They could have killed us.
They really do have an irony deficiency.
I honestly believe that in certain parts of America now, people have started to mate with vegetables.
And then with one problem behind us, we ran straight into another.
God! Lightning! You hear? This is God punishing us.
I'm just Did you hear that? It was a great time to discover that the wipers in my car were worse than useless.
This is like something out of a horror film now.
I'm in serious trouble, I cannot see a damn thing.
There were no exits and stopping on the hard shoulder in rain like this would have been suicidal, so there was only one choice.
You're on the lane.
Go right Jeremy.
Yep, now, this is very bad.
Left a bit Please stop raining, please stop raining, please stop raining.
You're on the lane.
Go right.
I think I am just gonna get out and kill myself, put myself out of misery God, help us.
It's me.
What with the storm and the rock-throwing rednecks, our fly-drive holiday wasn't going that well.
I just wanted to get on the big British jet and go home.
I want to be met by a homosexual in gray flannel trousers saying: "welcome onboard Mr.
Clarkson, can I get you a scull?" Yes, that's it.
We're in Louisiana.
All we had to do was get there and sell our cars.
And that, actually, would be quite a sad moment.
I love my Cadillac.
I mean, we've known each other like what? A few days and we've had this fantastic adventure to get all across America.
And it's my car now, and there are always foibles.
It's not the biggest truck, it's not the fastest, not best looking, but it just keeps going, it is like a little Welsh pony.
I respect that.
This car really is like living in an old house.
You know to keep the backdoor in a certain way to make it open.
This is the same with this.
I know how to keep the power steering going.
I know how to get the best out of what's left of the clutch.
I liked it as a kind of joke when we started but now, we're like we're like that.
Of course, there were certain other problems with selling our cars.
This very very bad Cadillac weave going along this, straight stretch, so I'll keep my worry beads to hand Relax.
We're in New Orleans and something has come off the Camaro.
Temperature gauge is off the scale.
Come on! Finally though, we made it.
And my word were we in for a shock.
We had seen on the news what Hurricane Katrina had done.
But seeing the devastation for real was truly astonishing.
Oh my God! Oh, look at that.
Well now, this is extraordinary.
Every house, I've been driving now, what, 15 miles, there isn't a pavement, there isn't a building, there isn't anything that isn't smashed.
It's such a vast scale of destruction.
A year had passed since Katrina had blown through and we sort of assumed that after 12 months the wealthiest nation on earth would have fixed it.
But we were wrong.
How can the rest of America sleep at night knowing that this is here? It certainly gave us a problem: The original plan had been for us to sell our cars here and see who can get the most money.
But in the midst of all this, that just seemed wrong.
We therefore had a con-flat and decided that we should give our cars away.
So we called a local mission who put us in touch with some families who lost theirs in Ketrina.
It got an alloy.
It's all standard.
It's not been messed with anyway.
I met the guy who had it before.
It's 150,000 miles and look: It's like new under there.
- I like it.
- Done.
It's yours.
Take the truck.
It's yours.
Look after it.
It'sit's been a good friend to me.
Alright.
I will sure do.
Jeremy did his usual trick of telling it like it is.
Rev counter, not good.
Speedo, not good.
Fuel gauge, not good.
Dent on the roof, that was caused by a cow.
As far as driving is concerned, the engine is brilliant.
Gear box, tiptop.
It's a good car.
It's all yours.
So, although it hadn't been the most relaxing holiday It had been a proper boys-own adventure.
And what's more, we could go home knowing that we'd done a little bit to help those less forturnate than ourselves.
Well, Richard and I could but James sadly couldn't even give his car away.
- It's still here.
- A family came around this corner, not 10 minutes ago, - Oh, thank you.
We lost everything in Hurricane Katrina.
- And rejected it.
Do you want a lift to the airport, in my car? - No.
I don't - No.
I will walk.
Thank you.
- Hammond, can I borrow the jump leads? - No.
I reckon if you look on Google Earth you'll be able to see his car, cause it'll still be there.
Plus, it won't be that hard to see it, either, it's big enough.
No.
Ok.
So there is no doubt that James lost that challenge.
And equally no doubt that I won.
Hang on.
How did you arrive at that? Well, my Camaro was the fastest, It had the best brakes, it didn't break down apart from the wipers much.
So it was the best.
It wasn't actually quite as easy to give away as you made out in that film, was it? Well, I sort of Why don't you tell the ladies and gentlemen what happened after the cameras had been turned off.
Well, a lady came and she said she was a lawyer representing the Christian mission that we'd gone to.
And she said she'd been promised by one of our researches a 1991 Camaro, and it was an 89.
and she said that was misrepresentation and she was going to sue me.
It really did happen.
Then she said that if I gave her $20,000 in cash, she might be able to make the case go away.
And you won't believe what happened to us next.
No.
Which was that a very very large pickup turned up full of heavily armed very burly men, told us to get off their street.
Yes.
So really, we do have 2 Top Gear Top Tips for you tonight.
One: yes, you can buy rather than rent, and Two: don't go to America! Top Gear is back to its normal self next week.
So we'll see you then.
Thanks for watching.
Good night!

<|endoftext|>

On the show Tonight, one small stumble for man as we build a space-shuttle I drive a nuclear bomb disguised as a Mercedes And Simon Pegg makes a Hot Fuzz in our reasonably priced car Help! You're wrong, you're wrong.
Hello and welcome to an arguement You see, there are two types of petrolhead You've got idots like this who like the Porsche 911 and you got people like me who'd rather have anthrax than a 911 cause I'm a Ferrari-person Yes.
But when you actually owned a Ferrari you couldn't leave it parked on the street, go have a dinner really or anything cause you'd spend the whole meal worrying about who is bumping into it or carving their names into its precious painting That's true.
I once left the roof off, it was so full of phlegm when I got back.
You could've swam home, but Exactly, and therefore as a result of that it'd spend its entire life carrying in your home or your garage And when you are eventually brave enough to wanna use it by that time, the battery was flat.
It was hopeless.
Yes, I know.
But a Ferrari with a flat-battery is an aesthetic thing You could enjoy looking at it.
That's the Yes, but it's not moving That's why I love the 911 because you can use it everyday to go to places It's a car! And now there is a new turbo version which we asked him to drive and hope he'd see the light This is the biggest 911-turbo they've ever made but it's still no longer than a Toyota Prius no wider than a 3-series BMW And unlike a normal super car it doesn't have Marilyn Monroe hips so it doesn't get stuck in multi-storey car parks What's more, it's not like threading through traffic in a post box in a Ferrari, you can't really see where the buses are, so you got problem up but in this, you can In a Ferrari, you'd be forever worried about graunching the nose on a speed hump but not in a 911 And it doesn't even harm the sky very much either It may have a flat-6 twin turbo engine but it only produces 300 carbondioxides that's 100 less than you'd get from the back of a Ferrari 430 If you drive this car through a really polluted city Los Angeles, /, Harrowgate, something like that the gas coming out of the exhause pipes is less toxic than the air going into the engine and I'm not joking.
That's true This then is like a small efficient easy-to-use vacuum cleaner I should have called it a Porsche-Dyson And it will suck up your luggage too because unlike any other supercar its boot is easily big enough for you weekly shop There is the peach and peacock the corner stone of any Porsche driver's Sunday lunch and there's still room left over for the ice-cream made from the bones of you defeated squash opponent.
And you can use this car on a school run because it has back seats.
I mean obviously You'd have to have fairly thin children but then you would have because you've got a Porsche 911 so you'd have a thin wife I'll conceive then there is no everyday situation that flummoxes a 911 turbo And so because you can use it everyday its battery won't be flat when the moment is right and you'll fancy your drive The new 911-turbo has special variable vane turbochargers that always work, whatever the rev is.
You could even buy a special overboost facility which for brief moments can deliver 500 torques that gives you the very muscly feel And it got a special new Four-Wheel-Drive system that it doesn't allow any form of under or over steer You just get so much grip that your eyes start to hurt like being in a capsule of speed So, when the sun goes down you could really get cracking OK.
Let's engage the stability management program and put it in sport mode that changes things a bit Now every time I turn the steering wheel it feels like I'm drawing a line through the laws of physics This is not driving, this is pure math So how does it compare to my beloved Ferrari Well, it has a smaller engine but because of the scramjet turbochargers it produces 480 BHP exactly what you get from a 430 But then this is lighter than the Ferrari thanks to aluminum doors which weigh just 11 Kg each It's also 20,000 pounds less expensive Sure, it isn't as exiting as the Ferrari it's more about engineering than passion but I would admit the end results are astonishing Let me give you some performance figures Top speed, near as makes no difference, 200 miles an hour and this is my favourate, OK? 40-60 in 2nd gear, 1 second It's amazing because it's not just more usable than a Ferrari more practical But I think out here in the real world with crests and dips and bumps and blind brows I think it's faster as well I really do Now, you see Ladies and gentlemen we must all rejoice because Clarkson has finally caught the bug I still prefer the Ferrari Well, hang on.
You've just spend the last 6 minutes wasting our time telling us that's faster, more powerful, lighter and more practical And cheaper.
The thing is, now, I'm sorry that's like sitting in a Volkswagon beetle with mustard up its bottom Well, it's better than sitting there in a car that won't start but just looks a bit pretty.
Look, can we just Can I say this arguement has been going on for 40 years It will go on for another 40 years.
The correct place is in the pub So we will do the news No.
Cause I've just thought of something else.
OK? It's really simple.
It's all to do with I have passion for the Ferrari.
I respect that but I have pas It's like David Attenborough I respect David Attenborough and we just infinitly respect in the same way we respect that car but I have no passion for him.
I don't wanna make love to him But I have respect and passion for the 911 There you are.
You've just admit on TV you wanna make love to David Attenborough He has just said that.
Your logic sometimes, mate, is the most annoying thing Shut up! - OK? We should do the news.
- Right.
And now the news.
And we begin this week with with the Porsche 911 more specifically the Porsche 911 GT3 RS Oh now, that's the business.
It's faster, it's lighter, it's tauter, it's possibly the ultimate 911 In the same way the Ebola is the ultimate tropical disease.
What's with all that scaffolding in there? It's a roll cage for when you take it on the race track I'm sorry.
If I see scaffolding around a building, I don't think that one's finished.
I'm sorry, actually they're unfinished.
No, it's a roll cage.
Look, I'll admit this is perhaps the only problem with this otherwise brilliant car is that it's not the most practical If you wanna pop down to the newspaper shop, you've gotta clamber in over the roll cage lower yourself into the bucket seat do up the 6-point race harness prime the fire extinguisher system it's gonna take time.
So in the real world, my 1.
2 Liter fiat panda is faster to the shops - No, mate, it's just not - I only have to put the seat belt on once, You've got to do it 6 times.
OK.
I've got to do that and then wait while you put you seat belts on and then do all your pre-flight checks make sure the air vents are working Can I just move this along? Do you mind? Is that alright? Coz I've got something that's really bugging me.
Has anyone seem these average speed cameras they are kicking around now? Do you know what I mean? So you've got to do I was xxx the M25 the other day, through the road works, had to do an average of 40 miles/h measured by 2 cameras, 1 at the beginning 1 at the end.
That's impossible It's impossible because you're driving along and you sort of looking around and Oh god, I'm doing 42 coz I'm doing down hill You think that I've been doing that for half a mile so I need to do half a mile at 38 which means you could only look at the speedometer You can't look at anything else only the speedometer You're going through road works in a m25 in the rain in rash hour.
And I know what they're doing here.
It's the government.
Gordon Brown has worked out that he's got to pay all our pensions coz we're gonna live for ever.
They are trying to kill us off.
I know how to get round it, ok? Go pass the first camera, pull over, get the newspaper out, read it, listen to the radio for 10 mins.
do 120 for the rest way of it.
That's not quite wrong actually.
Coz I can prove that the way to keep traffic moving through the road works which is where those average cameras are is for everybody to go faster from the start.
.
- Yeah.
- It's all down to the work of the Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli.
You're familiar with him? Oh, him.
- Thought so.
- He isn't.
He is.
He's never heard of him.
But what he essentially proved was that in a system, the pressure and the volume multiplied together must be a constant, so if you've got a busy motor way and it gets thinner, there's less space for the cars to go through they must go faster for the flow rate of cars to remain the same.
So it's like when you put your thumb over the end of a hose pipe, the water comes out quicker.
That's exactly what it's like, yeah.
So how fast then if you take 3-lane motorway down to 1 lane? How fast does the traffic have to move in order to keep the flow rate the same? Well the formula would be Vn=Lo/Lr*Ve So how fast? It's 210 - 210 miles/h.
Yeah.
Ladies and gentlemen - Fair enough.
All go and buy Bugattis and Zondas to cure congestion.
Of course the big news this week that's been occupying all the bulletins is that 1.
5 million people have signed this petition protesting about the plans to implement road charging, pay-as-you-go stuff.
Now if you want to add your name to that petition here is the address That's the address, now obviously, this being the BBC if you think road pricing is a good idea and you want to register you thoughts on that and best of luck with that.
The Mitsubishi Evo, we love that car, it's a great car, isn't it? Well this is the new one, the Evo 10, this is what it's probably gonna look like, um they've loaded it with loads of technology again, it's got all these initials, ACED, AYC,ASC, SAWC, MIVEC Good, yeah, keep talking like that If that's got all the technologies, - I mean, really road-crushing technology.
-It had to be there.
And it looks as good as that.
- Suddenly, why do you need super cars? - Yeah, why do you? Coz It looks like that and goes as well as it could, there is a slight warning associated with those cars there, because of all that technology, I mean when they really do, they're gonna be unflattering to drive, like one of those automatic pianos where you play it and you take your hands off and it carries on playing there's a danger the cars are like that.
If you get passengers with you and they are looking at you admiringly thinking: Wow what a brilliant driver, you're excellent! Don't take your hands off the wheelcoz - It will keep going.
- Then you'll look like an idiot.
And now, a couple of time, recently on the program, we've said that there'll never be a car to beat the Bugatti Veyron in our life time, it's the ultimate expression of the automotive engineering, and will be for some time.
Turns out, we might have been wrong, because look at this.
this is called the melling hell cat got some figures for you it's got a 6 liter quad-turbo V10, 1175 brake horse power, and the top speed they're saying of 270 miles an hour.
- Oh rubbish.
- What? That's rubbish.
I bet you that's not slippery enough.
- You mean not aerodynamic enough? - Yeah.
Can you please not ask me to be the one to find out.
I just don't fancy it.
Hey, last week, did you see the American program last week? You know we got into a spot of bothering a petrol station in Alabama? Turned out we missed the trick.
Coz you know when that woman came out and she said "Are you gay or looking to get beat up in a hip town or what?" and I said "Oh no no, actually IÂ¡Â¯m married with 3 children".
If only you'd said "well, actually IÂ¡Â¯m married with 2 children", we could have just pointed at the bachelor boy there.
"But the one with the long hair isn't.
" Of course they would have kicked the snot out of him.
Chaps Yeah? News from the BBC, ok? If you're a BBC employee and you drive flea cars or hired cars, you've now got to go on a safe-driving program.
But we drive though, do we have to? We do, yes we do.
No way.
I'm absolutely not kidding.
it says here that uh BBC driving is now acknowledged as one of the most serious work related health and safety issues.
It isn't.
it's just something that's more comfortable than walking.
- Yes.
- And then it goes on, the BBC committed in reducing the risk associated with this activity.
They're making it sound like masturbation.
Stop driving or go blind.
Exactly.
This isjust I've got some of the questions and IÂ¡Â¯d like to share some of the questions BBC employees have to face with you, ok? Ready? We'll bring them up on the screen here.
You have a blow out on the motorway.
One for you here, Hammond, what instinctive reaction should you avoid? Accelerating.
Tyre's gone, eeeeee This is instinctive reactions? Taking your hands off the steering wheel? Well, that'll help.
They're just maniacs, they're justI'm so irritated by this i can't believe it, and then Exceeding the speed limit in a built-up area is acceptable in vehicles fitted with anti-lock braking systems.
You strongly disagree, disagree, agree or strongly agree.
It's not gonna be an excuse, is it? Yeah, officer, it's ok, IÂ¡Â¯ve done 110 through the village, I have ABS.
No ticket for me.
Why are you looking angry with me, officer? What's the primary hazard facing drivers when driving at night? Anyone wanna a hazard guess of that? Hang on, this is.
.
go onwhat? Yeah? What? Dark? Anything else? Germans.
Germans? These are all valid points.
None of these things are on my list.
Anybody else got any thoughts? Peasants.
No, it's um glare from other vehicle's headlights, cyclist in dark clothing, that's their own fault for not working hard enough having a car Fatigue, staying alert.
And it now means you've got to spend 20 minutes next week failing the test and then going on a course, So IÂ¡Â¯m sorry we won't be here ladies and gentlemen next week, but we'll be much safer drivers when we get back.
Now here on Top Gear as you know we like a bit of challenge, we've made amphibious cars, we've made a convertible people carrier, but now it's time to see if we can conquer the final frontier--the space.
No.
Hangwellwhat do you mean no? No.
Now, you see, we wanted to find out if you could make a car into a spaceship.
Yes, and I thought this was the single stupidest idea IÂ¡Â¯ve ever heard in my life and refuse to have any part in it.
Ah, you see, but you underestimated the genius of our space-based plan.
One of the problems with space rocket is that they're gaint expensive.
the Super Power spent billions trying to get their hardware up amongst the stars But we thought you can do it for a lot less cash if you base your space rocket on a car.
That meant getting hold of the most rocket shaped car we can think of.
Yes it's been around for 30 years, and for Now though, we're gonna see if the Reliant Robin has the makings of a spaceship.
It's light, It's cheap.
And it tapers to a point like a rocket.
So we're already heading in the right direction.
But we're not just gonna strap rockets to it, set it off and wave it good-bye.
Because we're gonna see if we can turn it into the most difficult of all space craft.
The one has to take off, and been used again.
A space shuttle.
If you're eight, you're probably gonna wanna see what happens next.
Our first job had been to put a call-in to the rocketeers.
These were the men who'd helped to send a Mini down the skee jump for the Top Gear Winter Olympics Two One Initiate James and I convened a meeting at their headquarters, just out side the Derbyshire Town of Glossop.
It's not exactly the Kennedy Space Centre, is it? Oh, I don't know.
Inside we'd assembled a /mockly crew of boffins.
Right gentlemen, What we want from you is the most difficult type of space rocket A space shuttle This has to work properly, it has to have the big fuel tank it has to have the booster rocket, they all have to seperate.
Most importantly, we have to be able to bring it back down under control to a landing.
And it's worth say as well though.
No body's gonna go in this.
- Yeah.
- But it has to be landed.
The idea of this is that we will send it up to a few thousand feet What we're doing is testing the principle if you can make all this work, and we and bring it into this controllable landing We will probably get funding from the EU for a proper space mission So you want to launch it? Jettison the SRBs - Jettison the SRBs - Jettison the orbiter, and fly it down? What's the orbiter? - The Reliant - Right Have you got a spare billion dollars? No, you see that's why we've come to you.
Because you're from Manchester and you'll be able to do it for ten and six And as much teas as you can drink while you do're doing that.
Yeah, chips and lard, everything, anything you want.
The rocket men did some calculations on the back of a laptop.
How do you make the bloody thing work? Well we've got the Robin.
They've given us a Robin now.
That's it's started, right.
Whoopee, whoopee, whoopee, we've got a Robin.
An hour later, and it looks as though Jeremy might have had a point.
It is difficult in every single way.
Right.
You've got a Reliant Robin, It's a car.
So it should really really heavy.
Yeah.
So, rough numbers were we're gonna need about Really? It's the largest non-commercial rocket launched in Europe.
It's the most powerful non-commercial rocket launched in Europe.
Right.
As a rocket, it is the most awful shape it could ever be.
But I thought the Robin was a good place to start, because it's pointy at one end.
That's as far as I've got with that.
It's pointy, Yeah.
Never the less they set to work with James in tow.
While May was in his element in world's biggest lockram shed Oh, look at that.
I was trying to work out how to land the Reliant Robin.
The rockets have deployed, Err.
so we land itlike that.
I wrestled with the problem for ages before I had a brain wave.
Hello is that Model Airplane Monthly? Great, Em.
I need some help.
This I think is the answer.
We put a more powerful version of whatever this is to our space shuttle.
Then we can take control of it from the ground after its jettison in this rocket and flied in by remote, it's a good plan.
Just got to get good to fly it.
I thought it best to sack myself from this job and instead hired Steve Holland A champion model air plane pilot.
Yeah, now that is more like it, this.
- How are you at flying cars? - Cars? Cars, small cars.
With Steve the pilot onboard I went back to check on James' build and I was in for a shock.
Deep hell James, it's enormous.
That's a solid rocket booster, there are two of those.
That hasn't even got its nose cone on yet, it's actually a bit bigger than that.
But it'sI was thinking firework on a stick I know.
So was I, but that isn't the biggest bit.
No, the external fuel tank was the biggest bit Complete with extra rockets in the bottom Then there were more rockets in the Reliant.
And explosive bolts to seperate every thing.
The whole construction was mind bombingly complicated.
What occures to me now is the list of things to go wrong.
It's enormous.
Yeah.
And if anyone of them goes wrong See I've been worried about the landing.
The chance of getting as far as the landing on the day are now How did you get on with your flying, by the way.
Err.
.
Good.
The next problem was a biggie.
The rocketeers were worried that because of the Robin's odd shape The whole shuttle will spear off course during the ascent.
So we are happy we've got the power.
Yeah, eight tons of thrust.
And the thing only weights 1.
5, so it's gonna go, someway.
It's not gonna work, is it? - Well it's got to work, we're quite a long way into it now.
- Hehe.
.
What's that? Yeah, now now, but you see, look at it like this, it makes a lot more sense.
May we gotta make sure it doesn't just launch I mean it can't it could fall onto its back in the sky or anything This isn't about power now.
This is about the shape of it.
- And now that would affectwhere it goes.
- Yeahwhere it goes.
It's air dynamic, we need an air dynamic's expert to look at all the stuff.
One groveling phone call to the University of the West of England.
And we secured permission to use their wind tunnel.
And because it was free, We assumed it was self-service.
Go Well? What do you mean goI don't know what Err.
.
Do that.
That's good! No matter how hard he tried, James couldn't make himself into the shape of a Reliant Robin.
Even with help.
Thankfully, two eggheads arrived with a scale model of our shuttle.
- You see a beard like that, and you know you're in safe hands.
- Yep.
Basically We're looking for anything air dynamic than Nasty? Yeah, the Reliant is a proper mal-air dynamical thing.
Well they didn't really design it with this in mind, did they.
Is there any washout or washin on the winds? Basically.
.
simple.
.
the air force I don't know what you two are saying.
Well this is the air force actually doing Done.
Alright.
So, the big question, will it fly? I took it from his silence that he had his doubts.
And it wasn't alone.
Like the real thing our shuttle would glide back to earth without power.
And Steve our pilot had also built a model to show how well it did this.
What it actually gonna feel like to fly do you think? It's gonna come down like a lift with a cable cut.
You're not filling me with hope, Steve.
Well, most normal air plane they sort of glide for about, you know, they fly 20 feet forward they lose about a foot in height.
Afraid the Robin is the other way round.
Three, Two, One.
And when the model was released from its tow plane It's just plummeting to the earth! I'd rather you than me, I tell you.
So, there were doubts about our space shuttle going up, and doubts about it coming down.
But it was too late to worry now.
Because she was ready, and on her way to the launch site.
Don't worry, I still like cars, I promise Ah, anyway, we'll pick up their ludicrous story later on But now it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car My guest tonight is the hero of a new American Hollywood action film That's set in a sleepy British village sort of die hard beat.
Anyway here he is, Simon Pegg.
How are you? Good to see you.
Have a seat.
Thank you very much.
A super star Now um, I got to say, we don't really do plugging very much on this show Yeah not very good at it, and also like to say how it is, you know? You keep it real.
If some wobbler comes with a new record that's terrible we got to say "Your record is terrible" but your new film "HOT FUZZ", man that's funny Good Now as far as I could work out, the idea is to make British cops cool, is that right? Yeah, we just thought everythat there'd been a big sort of tradition of of like British films being about the gangsters and being about the crime sort of world, because it's easier to make them look cool coz they've got shooters and stuff, you know? Whereas the British cops have gotit's slightly against them in terms of their cool.
It is a very traditional force, you know the uniform is only just starting to get practical and so it's hard to be cool and a British cop.
um And the one thing that was difficult for our police force in terms of the coolometer is the pointy tall hat which pregnent women are still allowed to wee in.
That's true.
If they are caught short in the town centre You are allowed to wee in the policeman's hat? Absolutely, if you're pregnent.
Oh I can claim that.
Come here officer, oh, thanks a lot mate.
Now, so that people could know what we're on about I've actually made sure we've got a clip for this film, ok? Oh good.
And it's a bit in the supermarket.
Yes.
When they have, you have a gun fight.
We do, in the battle of somerfields.
The battle of som So let's have a look at that.
What are you thinking? Well, this is straight now, we've got the element of surprise, not gonna wait more time for them to get mobilise.
I say we go in through the front entrance, take the place all by awe they won't be expecting that.
Very good, what he said.
My my, here come the fuzz.
Maybe they are not here? Wait here.
- Don't go in on your own.
- Don't worry, he knows what he is doing.
Ok, They're in, you deal with the store, I'll deal with the trolley boy.
Aye? Oh, shi Oh It is, it is marvelous there.
First question we got to ask is Did somerfields let you do that or did you just go and? Yeah, they didIIyou know I've got maximun respect for somerfields now.
Becauseweyou know, we wrote them a letter and said "Look, we're gonna have a big fight in one of your supermarkets if you don't mind.
" It's all in good fun, it's meant you knowwith a grammar of affection.
And they were like "Alright".
And the other one of course we've got to get onto car chases.
Yeah.
Again the American car tends to be rear wheel drive, police chase.
You used Astra diesels.
Nothing but the best well that's what theyou know, a lot of uhof the police are kinda lumbered with and because actually the chase is uhis is it's another Astra diesel in the chase it's like fire and ice, that chase would never end until the fuel run out do you know what I mean? Coz there is no It's two Astras chasing each other.
It's like the unmovable force and the unstoppable object.
The other awful thing of course about the Astra diesel is you know those "World's wildest police chase video" thing? Yeah.
I once watched one of those in America.
they said we got a clip from England and I thought "I'm just gonna die of shame" And sure enough it went around the corner on a housing estate and bumped into a plant pot and there is your You say you had some driver training for the film, did you have gun training as well? Ah, we did a couple of days.
I was pretty professional anyway.
Are you a gun man? I've got a bunch of weaponsIII "pack heat".
We had some amazing days of just whole days running through Wales town centre firing of Winchester 1300M pump action shotguns - 1300M? - it's a lovely weapon.
- Yeah I like the way you throw the modern name in there.
Nick Frost calls ithehe called it Emma, he was that attached to it.
And when we were doing space, he had to dismantle a gun uh for the show so he took a replica MP5 gun which was a machine gun, um took all his clothes off, no, hestripped to the waist, it was summer time, he put a blindfold on and was kinda doing this, took the blindfold off to check the watch and there were 8 armed police officers in the living room with their guns drawn like you knowand they made the decision that if Nick went like that as opposed to that which is what I did - they were gonna shoot him.
- Really? Yep, and he phoned me afterwards "Simon, they" He said, apparently he was going "I'mI'mI'm an actor! I'm an actor!" And they were all like "where's your equity card?" "They've changed the role and you don't need one anymore.
" Now, can I just move on, coz films, you're a bit of a buff, I gather.
I am a bit.
- Starwars in particular.
- Yeah, absolutely.
Did you not once write a 3500 word essay on why you thought C-3PO was gay? Hahaha, no no, that was a part of the what I wrote was I did it I analyzed Starwars from a Marx's perspective in terms of saying well that was the idea that I never lost the things in the Starwars that are pretty right wing It came after Vietnam.
It was a big expression of the American white middle class power in the rejection of the old order of the English and you could argue that C-3PO was kind of musculated homosexual.
- I don't - Coz he's very camp but he was safe, coz he didn't have a "willy".
So it was ok.
He was Homosexual men have "willies"? He was sexually non threatening.
Graham Norton's got a willy.
How do you know? Do you know, I must admit, when I was doing my lap, uhIIwas just wishing I could hear the Stig like Ben Kenobi.
Yes.
You know, I mean "Slower on the corner, Simon, slower on the corner".
Anyway, listen, who would like to see Simon's lap? Ok let's have a look at this.
Good speech.
That's good.
Nice, slight wheel spin.
That's kinda my job, actually, that.
The commentry on what the car's like.
Oh yeah.
That was pleasant.
It's very pleasant.
Pleasant's not a word I've ever usedlook at that! That was my favourite bend, that one.
Why did youit was so good you just kept it going.
%^&* gear you bugger.
I heard, a leap from Hugh Grant there from a couple of weeks ago.
And nice.
This is good.
Help! That's the first cry for help we've had.
This wasthat was so much fun.
I've just seen you mi God if you can nail this one, you're laughing.
Look at those eyes.
No, where's the speed gone? I know, that was my worst corner.
No, oh you've slowed down.
- I know I know, what was I - Oh crossed the line there.
That was fast.
That was alright.
That's the adrenalin going.
It really really does, so much fun.
Where do you think you've come? I'd hope for kinda upper middle, but I hope above Coogan, please.
Above Coogan? You did it in 1 minute you're above Jimmy Carr, Yeah.
fourtyso already you are above Coogan Thank you.
I think if I nailed that corner, if I that was the one that bothered me I reckon if you'd have done those last 2 corners at sort of Michael Gambon speed for instance, you would have been up there honsetly with Gordon Ramsey.
Yeah.
That was a very good lap.
It felt really great.
Well, listen, best of luck with the film and thank you very much for coming, ladies and gentlemen, Simon Pegg! Thank you, thank you very much.
Now, in the olden days it was terribly easy to tune up a mass produced car.
You put a bigger carburetor on it.
You made an airscrew for the bonnet at the apply word.
And the way you went.
These days though, it not quite so easy.
No, and it's especially tricky if you start out something like this Mercedes SL65.
I mean how can a tuning company possibly make this better than it already is.
And if they could what kind of a monster would you end up with? Well, you end up with this: The most powerful convertible ever made Welcome every one to the 160 thousand pond Brabus S Bi-turbo roadster Sweet mother of God this is fast The secret to all this speed of course is the engine What Brabus do is take the standard Mercedes V12 and then throw almost all of it away only the cylinder block remains and even that is modified Everything else is new.
New and bigger.
The original car has 5.
5 liters.
This is a 6.
3.
and the result of that is dramatic.
That's more than any Bentley, it's more than any Ferrari, more than any Lamborghini even.
Of course it's not actually that difficult to screws 730 horse powers from an engine.
But it is difficult to put all that power on the road.
and it's /nile impossible when the engine is churning out almost ridiculous 1000 torques.
for restarting a dead planet.
It's so much that when they put the engine in a car it wouldn't move at all.
Traction control just set there go 'This is impossible' and when you turn the traction control off the rear wheel spun till the tires are burst.
as a result they've now limited it to just 811 torques, which is about what you use to power a medium sized aircraft carrier Now at this point you're probably expecting me to say that they've limited the top speed as well and I'm afraid they have.
to Amm 219 MPH The top speed is incredible, but the way it gets there boggles the mind I'm now going 180 faster then the top speed of an Apache helicopter gunship I'm running out off run way.
I suppose I ought to explain at this point that Mercedes limit this car to 155 MPH because that's the limit of what there is components can take.
So if you're going to make it go 219 MPH those components have to be changed.
That discreet body kit therefore is not for show.
It's there to keep me on the ground, which is handy when you're doing 320 feet a second and what kind of under floor engineering does the Brabus have to keep it in check at this kind of speed.
Well, put simply, It's all very big.
The breaks at the size of dustbin lids have 12 pistons each.
the tires could encompass Neptune and the speed the whole car sets lower to the road than the normal by 15 mm So has it worked? No, not really.
Even though they've reined in the torque, there's still far too much of it.
Every time you go near the throttle, even in a straight line you just get the traction control going 'Errrr.
.
I don't know what to do!' Even if you turn the traction control off this bigger Mercedes of course, it isn't really off.
you got the breaks stabbing away, and the back tires desperately trying to control the mountain of torque.
just wasting their time.
Honestly you may as well blow on an oil rig fire.
You have to develop a new technique, which is blast down the straight hard on the breaks Woo, I think I'm just made accreting the runway.
and then go very slowly.
slowly, eat the power in, steal the traction control spurning away and then Ohhhno, that was too much.
It's very hard work this.
and worse after a worryingly short amount of time the breaks were completely shot still at least this meant I can pull over and stop the madness In terms of handling then this car is a nightmare it just cannot cope with the volcano under the bonnet.
there then is two and a bit tons of prove that absolute power really does corrupt absolutely So it's rubbish.
well, we're gonna find out now by putting it on our track and that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
Some say that if you lick his chest it tastes exactly the same as piccalilli.
And that at this week's Brit awards he was arrested for goosing Russell Brand.
All we know is, he's called the Stig.
Way you go, his tires struggling to contain all the torques He's piling into the first corner already and mighty struggle between power traction control and the Stig Look at that! Unbelievable driving radio:"She could hear the others heart beating as if they share just one between" Stig's talking book collection getting another area in there as he bellows through Chicago not like he all that fast I gotta say look at it, lunatic of a car this thing through the Hammerhead Look you can actually see it wobbling around as the computers Look at it, struggling to try and keep it on straight and now nearly hitting the tyres up Radio:"I love him, she said to the Elvens, I love him.
" Through the Follow Through he can really wind it up here, make up some lost time But he has got to have lifted even the Stig's not that stupid.
No it just doesn't look that fast you just can't get the power on when you want to in it.
Second to last corner, just holding it on the track through Gambon barely containing explosion there and cross the line Well yeah you're applauding but, ready? an entirely predictable 1:26.
2 And the problem is, very straight forward OK? Mercedes spend a million ponds a day on research and development a million a day! So they've got the best brains in the world with all the money in the world to make the standard car as good as it can be.
However, I don't think that this it the end for tuning companys Because look at the Jag here OK? Now they spent 35p designing this Make no mistake, I love it, it's beautiful but I do think that there is more power to be got out off the v8 under this bonet this is a prime candidate for someone to come along and tune it up a bit.
You're right, you're right.
And what's more we're British, we're the inventors of everything! It is time to brace ourselves, hasten unto the shed, and liberate ourselves from the abyss made dark by the lights of perverted German science.
I c'n really has lost it this week, but it doesn't matter because we can move on, because it's time for the Cool Wall Yes and we're beginning We're beginning by move all the 4-wheel-drive cars down - All of them? Why? - All of them are going down No, hang on, why? Times have moved on Richard, 21st centry all that Look, OK I appreciate, but not all 4x4s are driven by women round Chelsea No, listen, I agree with you, I agree I'm sure with most people here - That 4x4s are not killing polar bears but - Some of us are living in the country we need them you can't just move them all down the wall Car's all about pulling womenfor us obviously You know what I mean, for blokes since it's what it all about.
You're not gonna pull Socialist woman with these because they don't like them What does that matter? I don't Sorry mate, you don't make any sense Socialists women are better in bed than tory women Let me put it to you this way, OK? I'll give you a straight choice: Vanessa Redgrave or Ann Widdecombe? Crikey, Vanessa Redgrave There you are.
And as a result they've all got to come down the board They're not cool any more driving around in there, they're just not.
and you know what I am gonna do to celebrate this? I'm gonna buy a Range Rover - Hahaha - And I'm gonna get a V8 one, petrol What have you got there? This is the new Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.
What do we think? How cool is that? Thiswhat? Subzero.
In the fridge, subzero, in the fridge subzero.
All wrong Hold on, hold on.
Everybody with your opnions.
There is couple of the really crucial things you need to know about this car Number one, he's just bought one.
Look at this Number two, I'm having the wall extended through that wall, downto add a really really really really really seriously uncool section.
I'm afraid that is true obviously.
If we buy one and we ruin the reputation of that car, which is why we put that over there But this, the Ford GT can at last come up here, coz I've got rid of it.
Now next one, Porsche 911 - GT3 RS - GT3 RS It's brilliant brilliant car - But? - Even I'm not gonna argue that that's cool This scaffolding, Kristin Scott Thomas, this is the test we have as you know She got in there :"Why have you got scaffolding in the back?" You'll have to explain:"It's a roll cage in case I fall over and park on the roof.
" In case I roll over, she's just going to get out.
"Why has it got a fire extinguisher?" In case we bust into flames on the race track.
Honestly all the stuff in there is like her opening the glove box going, "Why have you got Dettol in here?" WooIt's in case my eye inflection flares up again It's going right down here.
I'll tell you what, you know if you put a cockometer at the side of the road A what? A cockometer, you know when you driving to villages in these days tells you your speed If there was another one along side, like one of those thermometers outside the church.
selling you how much of a cock you look This be right off the scale if you drove by one of those.
I'm not joking.
What have you got? - Now it's a Kia Cee'd - Oh, for God sake - Ahh, Yes, now, hang on.
- I'm losing the will to live.
I'll die.
Does anybody here think that's cool? - Absolute rubbish.
- Have you driven one? No one want one.
- No.
Yes? - No.
Does anyone say yes? - Yes, there's a lady here saying yes.
- You've driven a Kia Cee'd? I work for Kia.
On purpose or is it just like bedding them unemployment into your town? It's a fabulous car and it's a fabulous company.
Really? - You're not helping me there.
- No.
Except for one tiny detail: the Koreans eat dogs You're gonna come down one more and you don't come crying for me if you find TopGear dog in a bap.
- Again it's your logic and it's frightening - It's uncool.
I'm telling you, I'm.
.
I won the money.
Come on beyond.
Why have you worked for Kia, have you got a TVR T-shirt on? Because TVRs are British, and they're fast, and they're subzero.
Everything Kias aren't.
Right Emm.
This, Ducati 1098 I'm sorry what you're doing It's a Ducati 1098 and I'd like to put it forward to go on the board In fact, I'd like to put it in the coolI seriously, know there is every reason why this is a very very cool bike.
It's an Italian super bike.
But it isn't just technically very very clever it also looks beautiful.
.
Ah.
Don't do it again.
- Do not put a motorcycle - Touched the nerve there I think Is that touched your nerve? - I may have - Do not put a motorcycle on the board Now look what's happened.
I'm sensing disagreement from you.
- Run, run or you'll be a lot shorter - I'm gonna Now, earlier on Richard Hammond and I were attempting to prove John F Clarkson wrong by turning a Reliant Robin into a spaceshuttle.
And when we left the action, it was all going terribly well.
The launch site was a military base whose where abouts are a top secret.
(Clanburne Military Training Ground, 53 miles N.
W.
of Newcastle) (Just off the A68) (Launch minus 2 days) The build began and soon the main fuel tank was assembled and attached to the launch pad.
Together with the solid rocket boosters, these parts contain the 8 and half tons of rocket power that'll be taking the reliant up into the Heavens.
Here's what terrifies me as it is here on that let's be honest: bit of sacffolding Yeah? Just the tiniestyou know eeek like that, that's Birmingham or eeek that's John o' Groats Look it's fine, it's held down with some old concrete blocks and some straps that you use to hold furniture down in the removal van.
That's perfect.
Right, there must be something useful we can do somewhere.
As it happened, there was We were sent off to dig a bunker for Steve the model airplane pilot who would glide the reliant in.
But that wasn't easy because the launch site is littered with unexploded bombs.
Thank you for choosing a precision metal detector with your metal detector you can hunt for coins, relics, jewellery, gold and silver just about anywhere.
- Does it say bombs? - No.
James had bought his metal detector at Argos(UK store) So I got myself some serious body armour.
You've found my JCB.
I've just worked out something though now from this it only works down to a depth of about 3 inches.
As it turned out, it all went rather well in the main.
Look what he's done.
You philistein! Finally our bunker was finished.
So that's it then, good.
With Steve now fully protected we went back to the launch site where there was good news.
Bang on time for it's date with destiny, the Reliant Robin had arrived.
- Huhhhh, you're alright, you're alright.
- Keep it coming.
- Alright.
- On that line.
- You're alright, you're alright.
- Yeah.
- Back.
- Nice and stop.
That is the business end of a reusable Reliant orbiter.
Wow.
Then we were entrusted with another job.
I reveal to you the legend.
You spanner.
What? That 's where it goes on the wing - But think what it's gonna look like when it's up there pointing upwards.
- Brilliant.
Up side down! (Launch minus 21 hours) As night fell, the most delicate and risky part of the operation began Attaching the reliant space orbiter to the rockets and fuel tank.
Not kidding, this bit is genuinely very scary because as they're mounting it, often it's quite complicated on the linkages if the shuttle clogs it and bends any of the release mechanisms, - it won't come off and then the shuttle and the tank will come down and - Yeah.
Shall we go over and help? I think not.
- Thinking about the really unNASA thing you said just now.
- What? Right, come on lads, let's get this Robin pluged Worker: Oh, ladder's coming out.
Again, at NASA they don't keep a step ladder on the launch pad.
- One small step ladder for - Hahahaha.
Jamesstop laughing, they get nearly crossed Finally, the Robin was attached and the completed shuttle made for a truly awesome sight.
Everything was looking good.
but later in our suite at the local "Ridge Sheraton" I was worried mad.
- Hammond? - What? What do you think of the chances of it actually working? It'll work.
It's just that you know when we do these big things they usually end in some sort of massive disaster I quite like this one to work.
(Launch minus 10 hours) Well it's up, it's built, but it's worth a quick reminder of exactly what is going to happen.
Absolutely, we've got 8 and half tons of rocket thrust to push that thing off the ground at about 1000 feet the 2 solid rocket boosters will be empty they will fall away and come down on the parachutes doing about 100 miles an hour then.
Yeah, it'll continue accelerating to about 140, then at about 3000 feet The orbiter itself will detach from the main body that's when Steve the pilot takes control it's his job to glide it in, he has the option of firing 3 rockets to extend that glide he'll then put it down on the deck of the landing strip and prove that it is a reusable craft.
- Yeah.
- Of course All that we've just said is just words.
- Words, yeah.
- Let's be honest.
Who knows.
The last few hours were taken up with final preparations and with such an ambitious project as this the complexity of the on board systems was simply staggering.
Each electronic component had to talk to every other electronic component at exactly the right time.
There have been 1 or 2 delays most of these are of an electrical nature There's a long wire leading from launch control down to the rocket and unfortunately that had a breakage some where.
James, a car ran through it.
Ok, but that's all sorted.
We're now fueling the bird.
And once that's done there can be no delays, it's full of fuels they're gonna have to light that candle.
Yeah.
The tension now was almost unbearable you could almost hear Jeremy preparing some intergalactic smarts.
So would it stay on course during the ascent? Would the rockets and the fuel tank detach? And would Steve who by the way have refused our kind offer of a bunker be able to pilot the Robin down safely? In just a few seconds, we'd know.
Oh yes! Separate! Separate! - Separate! - 12 1000 Technicians:Break! Separate! Oh no! - That's why - How were you gonna use it again? And uh That's enough, really.
Next week these 2 completely lose touch with reality and try to get to the centre of the earth with a lawn mower.
I think we did quite well.
By what measure do you arrive at that conclusion? Well, in fairness it was only 1 bolt that let us down.
There's only 1 iceburg that sank the Titanic, it's still sank.
The fact of the matter is you just blew a big hole in Northumberland.
Yeah, and next week where all of us ruining Banffshire with tractors.
That's true but don't worry because i'm also driving up and down our track very fast in a Lamborghini Uh so we really hope we'll see you then, take care.
Goodnight!

<|endoftext|>

Wah! I drive the new Lamborghini quite badly.
And the Cool Wall muse Kristin Scott Thomas is in our reasonably priced car.
Hello, hello and welcome.
Thank you, thank you, now.
Now, back in the summer, we were literally inundated with a letter from a railway company who asked us to do a feature on the show about the dangerous of level crossings.
Yeah.
Now even though we don't make Health and Safety public information films, I though I could pull it off until he bursted into the office and announced that he wanted to do it.
Yes, I will practise more serious voice and this is what I came up with.
It's a commonly held believe that younger drivers are the ones who cause more Britain's car accidents.
terring about on drugs with their hats on back to front.
But the truth is that eldly people are 3 times more likely to have a crash than their grandchildren.
Think about it.
When was the last time you heard of a young person driving the wrong way down a motorway.
Never.
It's always an old person in their 80s And how often do you heard about a teenager plying their car into the sea.
Again, never.
It's always an old lady in a Fiesta.
Chaos of OAP trip on M25 at 8mph Pensioner drivers into 7 cars But now it seems Briton's old people have found a new way to get their kicks.
Terrifyingly, they are jumping the lights of level crossings.
Look at this idiot caught on CCTV larking about in his Reliant Robin.
He was lucky not to kill someone.
We examine the footage more carefully, we see the really worrying thing.
He wasn't even wearing a high visibility jacket.
The trouble is that people have seen their grandparents driving through the redlights with no safety clothing at all, and think it's OK for them to do it as well.
The figures make for a poorly reading.
There are 1600 level crossings in Britain and according to British rail or whatever they're called these days, many people are injured on them very year.
You might think it's fun to jump the red lights.
You might think it will save you a few minutes.
You might think it's OK because your granddads alway doing it or because you've got a Renault Espace which has a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating.
But it's not alright.
Coz I shall now prove with a gratuity shot of a train smashing into Espace at very high speed.
(radio) Warning, Do not trespass on the Railway.
Penalty 1000 pounds.
That's quick.
You drove like that on a public road, you deserve to be called a maniac.
That's tossed! That's bad! I'd quite like to see that again, in slow motion.
And even slower.
So that is how far the train went from what, 70, 80 miles an hour.
The message then is clear.
Unless you want that to happen to you, Alway wear this.
Thank you.
Think! Always wear a high visibility jacket.
- See? idiot.
- What? Well, just what in the name of god was that? All they wanted you to do was to say "Don't run the red lights at level crossings.
" Yes, that.
And what sort of imbecile watches a train crashing into a car and then jumps up and down shouting "That's tossed" Unlike I've decided making public information films I'm gonna do on speeding.
No, really I'm.
Honestly, I'm gonna set you and May on fire, right? May gets on the motorcycle goes really fast to see if he can put himself out, you stand still Just no.
This is a bad idea, alright? Then I've got a skyscraper Anyway, listen, I'll flesh it out later, coz now we gotta do the news.
Yes, and we begin with the Maserati coupe, which is a car we've never been entirely sure about.
Mainly because we don't think it's that good looking.
However, there is a new one.
It's called the new Maserati Granturismo I have a picture of it and it's a thing of beauty, isn't it? - Oh, yeah.
- Gorgeous.
Hey, you can tell Kristin Scott Thomas is coming into the studio as a guest today.
- How? - He is wearing a suit.
Look at him.
It's All my jeans are in the wash.
Oh, really! All of a sudden, 92 programs we've done, you've been in jeans.
Now today when Kristin's coming in, They're all mucky! I thought he was going for a job interview.
He's got that.
Exactly the way.
It's exactly how he looks.
This Maserati - He's had his hair cut as well.
- Yes, haha! - He has! You have! - I've had my hair cut because it was too long.
- Last week - Were you combing it frantically before Shut up! What did you say? I was going to say last week I have mine cut and you said having your hair cut on a studio day was GAY! - Did you - I said you should spend more than 4 pounds on a hair cut, James.
That's what I actually said.
- So why didn't you? - Will you shut up! - Anyway, the M.
.
- This Maserati, what it got under the bonnet is a 4.
2 V8 Same as the old one.
Yep.
405 bhp, automatic gearbox, it's gonna be 73,000 pounds.
I'm besotted with it.
Right.
I think it looks absolutely stunning.
I mean if you're thinking of buying an Aston DB9 or a V8, now, that's the alternative.
It's a good looking thing but there's an alternative to the alternative It's got a sister car.
Let's have a look at that.
The Alfa Romeo 8C Come on, say it.
You've been practising all week.
Here we go.
Competizione.
Yeah! Bravo.
That's a legal word.
Sounds like I'm a /.
But it's related.
It's got a 4.
7L V8, so the engine is slightly bigger.
It's related underneath, but it's got this beautiful carbon fibre body over the top.
The only thing is, as an alternative, there's a problem.
They're only making 500 and they're all sold.
But I think that's better looking actually.
- Nah.
- No.
Maserati is better.
Put Maserati back up.
There you are.
It's better.
- I think the Alfa is better looking.
- No, I'd have that.
Oh why don't you ask Kristin which she prefers? I will.
It will be nice to talk to somebody intelligent.
Now, news this week, the most unsensible car I've ever heard of .
Volkswagen Passat.
Here it is.
It's all 36 got v6 engine four wheel drive body hugging sports seats, low profile tyres, whole nine yards the thing is though If you want a sport saloon, the last 2 words that pop into you head after say Mister and Kipling are Volkswagon and Passat.
It just doesn't make any sense.
No, it's like saying would you like some more fruit cake, vicar? It's got cocaine in it.
Ludicrous.
Now, hey.
On the way down here this morning, I saw something so amazing that I took a photograph of it.
Here it is.
I wanna stress I wasn't driving.
Er, obviously I was taking pictures, I was in the You were sitting on the drivers lap, brother, look at it.
I was doing that.
The thing is though, it's a Peugeot 1007.
- They sold one! - Somebody's bought one! Somebody went into a shop and said "I'd like a small car but can you make it really really heavy with really complicated doors.
And I'd like to pay money for that.
" Yes.
I want to go for 0-60 in 18 sec.
That's how slow it is.
Why are you in a Rolls-Royce Phantom.
The day that Kristin Scott Thomas is in you suddenly decide that you need to test a Phantom again.
Parked it just out side, have you by any chance? It's out there, yeah.
- Is it? - Yeah.
- where can be seen? - Yeah.
I was just thought it would Do you seriously think she is gonna be impressed by some yellow-tooth fat old man with toothful hair getting out of somebody else's Rolls-Royce.
At least he's had his pubes cut.
It's pathetic.
We have the results of a Top Gear survey.
This is where you tell us what it's like to own various cars.
And I'm delighted to say that the car that the most satisfying car that you can own according to the people who actually own it, I just test drived it is Car of champion for years the Honda S2000 again.
No no no.
And what do you say is the best small sports car? BMW Z4 Which came 62nd.
And you, Porsche Boxster as I recall.
You said that's better than a Honda.
That was 43rd.
- Oh, dear.
- Speaking of which, How are the electrical windows in your Porsche Boxster? - Fine.
- Still broken? No, they work.
I'm not always in it when they work.
He's very often in bed when they work.
Well, maybe.
But my other car the Fiat Panda, I think I'm right in saying What's funny about this? No, you couldn't be more right.
He does have a Fiat Panda.
And you're right, James.
It was in the top 10, with all the Skodas.
What people say here is that it was better than they thought it was going to be.
It's like which I was buying a ton of manure, it doesn't smell that bad, actually.
To be honest, I'm quite surprised by it.
Coz it's fun to drive, it's well made, it's economical, it looks good.
It says all of that in the magazine bumf but it also says that people claimed it was predictably slow - Which it is - It is, why don't you tell the ladies and gentlemen what happened when we all met up the other day to go on a shoot, met at the hotel we had to go to a location, you turned up in your panda.
I had an Aston that day and you had a 911.
Well, alright.
But in fairness, I had only picked it up that morning and it only had 8 miles on the clock.
and I didn't know what all the knobes and things did yet.
What do you mean knobes- there's only two knobes in it, well three if you count the one who bought it.
It's a simple car.
Anyway, I said "look, I haven't got a map.
Can I just follow you?" And they said "Yes, yes.
Of course you can.
Come on off we go.
" And they went off at 120 miles an hour.
You should have bought a faster car then you could've kept up.
You used it as an excuse last night to fondle my lap.
- You did.
- Rubbish.
I'll tell you.
He said "I'll give you a lift to the pub and.
.
" We got into a Fiat Panda and he kept saying "Stop touching me.
" You can not touch someone! It's like sharing a bath with somebody.
You've got He's got "get on the back of my horse but don't touch me.
" He exploited the diminitive size of my panda to sit there going "Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
" Can I just get back to this list, OK? I want to give you the bottom 6.
The 6 least reliable cars that you can buy.
See if you can spot a trend here.
Errsix from last, Peugeot 407, Citroen C8, Renault mÂ¨Â¦gane, Peugeot 307, Renault Espace, Peugeot 807 They are all French.
I know.
French got better things to do than go on making cars.
It's what it basically was.
- Pardon? - What? Oh for instance, France is a lovely country.
- Oh, come on.
- Hang on, hong on.
Where does Kristin Scott Thomas live? Paris.
That might have something to do with your sudden spirited defense of France.
No.
Coz I've always liked France.
- It is pathetic.
- I don't konw why you're laughing.
You'd be exactly the same if Graham Norton is coming on.
You won't? Anyway, that's the end of the news.
Now, as you probably know, these days it's possible to make petrol from crops.
and this gives us an idea.
Why don't we give it a bash.
I mean, how hard can it be? Well, one problem is that you would need to use tractors.
And tractors is something that we know absolutely nothing about.
So, the production office said "go on the internet, do some research," "and then turn up at our test track with whichever tractor you think would be best for the job of growing petrol.
" Right, gentlemen, this is what I've come up with.
That's the Fendt 930 Vario.
It's 120,000 pounds.
This is the Mercedes S class of agricultural vehicles.
This's got every single toy imaginable.
Well the best of all is it's got this computer, OK.
And it will maintain it at a constant speed of 0.
06 of 1 mile an hour This is the fastest he's ever been.
Jeremy's choice turned up next.
- There it is - Jeremy, that's a digger.
No, it isn't.
That's a JCB Fasttrac something or rather and this is the tractor that the army use.
Oh, the army.
Well known of course all over the world as farmers.
Just honestly, this, OK? It has It has what? It has an 8.
3L turbo charged engine.
Unlike any other tractor, I think, top speed is unlimited.
No, please, listen, seriously, if we're gonna make good quality petrol from our crop - Yeah? - We wanna get the ploughing done well, not quickly, OK? Which is why I have bought this! That's a bloody tank, you idiot.
It It didn't look that big on my computer, to be honest.
It's a Case STX Steiger.
That's got a 16L turbo charged engine It weighs 24 tons.
- It's just - How much is it? What's its top speed? Err, - 20 - 20 - 20 - 41 So this is therefore a faster plougher.
You can't plough at 41 miles an hour though.
Well, how fast do you plough? I don't know.
Our ignorance about farming was a little embarrassing, so we dived into the first challenge.
- Ready? - It's the big moment.
Farming has a very high suicide rates, which can be attributed to stress.
The last thing you need therefore is a tractor that's confusing to operate.
So to test user-friendliness, you must hitch up a trailer, get in, adjust the seat, turn on the lights, and then reverse your rig through our car park.
Wohoo Quite big, some of these things.
It's a tight car park there.
And unfortunately, it's always full of stuff.
On that days for example, there was a very expensive modified Range Rover Sport, A prototype Astra with a new type diesel engine, and all our cherished TV creations.
James went first and instantly regretted choosing the S Class.
Fifteen minutes, James, and utter silence.
I'm just making sure everything is right before I start Start it now, then.
It's very quiet.
I say amazing modern tractors.
Eventually he did get it started.
And he had to find 1st gear So that' something to do with my bo it's not thatthat's It's now been 26 minutes.
Hang on.
There is the windscreen wiper Do you think he's found the gear lever? It's taken him 34 minutes.
I've managed to adjust the steering wheel.
It can't be that difficult.
You'll notice, ladies and gentlemen, 1 hour has passed, the trailer's And the tractor is no near it How did I do? Don't hold out too many hopes.
Unbelievably, I have no trouble getting my JCB started and into gear.
It moves, it leaves.
- C'mon, a bit more, stop.
- Hitching the trailer was a doddle too.
Yes! All I had to do now was reverse it.
This of course is a 4-wheel trailer.
Slightly harder to operate.
It's the opposite of the opposite of what you think.
- Wrong.
- You're getting wronger.
How can you crash into your own trailer? No.
Oh, this is stupid.
The thing interesting about Jeremy I find is he thinks problems can be solved by shouting.
This is just ridiculous! It can't be done! He's getting further away.
I'm not a quitter, but I'm quitting.
Hammond being a country boy instantly bonded with the job in hand.
Here we go.
That's really annoying.
Yeah, you see? I'm on the roll.
Stop! Stop! Stop! I think I did clip it.
How many are these worthy? None, since you did that.
How did you get Well, it weighs 24 tons, it's very big, you can't see much when you looking backwards.
And I was Frankly, we'd all made a hash of that challenge.
It was probably best to move on.
Right then, time for our next challenge.
- Yes.
- Thank you very much.
Here it is.
The slowest thing ever to lap our track was the late Richard Whitely.
He went a round in 2:06.
Can your tractors beat this? - What, go slower than that? - Yeah.
That's stupid.
Well what's the stop you just driving really slowly? Ah, no.
We won't be driving.
The Stig will.
Oh, god.
So is it the slowest or the fastest? It's the slowest.
I've brought the fastest tractor down here.
This is excellent.
And with its top speed of 31, the Stig could hardly have been less bothered about the prospect of a lap in the Fendt.
Go! That's good.
That's good and useless.
Get off the line.
That doesn't exactly spin its wheels.
And it's 1 min now, and he hasn't made it to Chicago.
And is it cross theNo The Stig's performance also wasn't helped by the fact that the James had adjusted the seat to its softest setting.
-Oh my God! -I'll be running.
- Yes! - What was it? That's spectacularly slow.
Hopefully, my office block would beat, Err, not beat, I mean, that time.
Wheel spin! Wheel spin! No, that's bad.
I don't want wheel spin.
Abnormal quiet - What can we - How do you commentate on a tractor lap? - Go on the Hammerhead.
- If you notice that the Lamborghini tractor, they'll do Hold on, sorry Sorry to interrupt, James, but will it understeer going round the Hammerhead? No.
As I was saying, You know what, we've been lucky with this You know, I mean barely a cloud.
No,no, it's /.
It's the gorgeous weather.
Why do things stay hot in the thermos flask for less time than they stay in the cold? - Well, it's interesting.
Why - Don't go there.
How does it keep being hot, in fact As we finished afternoon tea, the Stig roamed home Come on, come on, yes! In the speedy JCB GTI, that time wouldn't be easy to not be, not, wait, hang on Look at it, it's leaning.
Of course it's leaning, it's a very very powerful 8.
something L engine.
In fact, the JCB GTI was so fast that even the Stig had trouble coping.
- Come on.
- No, slow is good, you fool.
The last corner, turning in Cross the line.
Read it and weep.
- No, that's Jeremy, the slowest wins.
- Rubbish.
Hopefully, there'd be no disagreement about the final challenge.
The most important characteristics for any tractor are fuel efficiency, reliability and long service life.
So your next challenge is a dragrace.
Oh, god.
I've got this one completely sewn up.
No, no, no, you haven't.
You misunderstood, it a drag-race.
We each have to look around the whole of the Top Gear site and find something big and heavy to drag.
In the race, we get more points for the bigger and heavier the thing is I hitched up Jeremy's 'Toyboata' Hilux, the S class country cottage, my Triumph Herald sailing boat, and, well, a few other things.
Nice try, but a bit wet.
Even the office's lack of wheels was no problem for my metal mammoth's 1,600 torques.
Again, good effort.
But to my mind, still lacking ambition.
Right, I'll think low range.
Three Two One Go! This is it We're away in the most ridiculous dragrace in history James's cars are all over the place.
the convoy's shaking a bit, shaking a lot.
No quite as brightly as how I was hoping.
Come on, come on.
it's a tractor.
I've now reached, after 25 sec, 1.
3 miles an hour.
What do you think? That's what it spares, it's all over the place.
There's a big weave going on.
Oh, I've lost one.
Wahl, come off my way.
It's gonna be a disaster.
It's the finishing line.
Not the most elegant finishing in the world but I believe I have beaten old merc Hammond.
Wake me up when we get there.
Now, emm.
Obviously we will be picking that up later on when we start actually growing petrol But now it's time to put a star in our reasonably-priced car.
My guest tonight is a Hollywood star She is currently staring on the West End stage and one of the great classic, she is the epitome of cool.
She Wow, I wish your heart fluttering as you talk about it.
And your tongue goes really big in your mouth Will you two grow up? Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, Kristin Scott Thomas How are you? Very well.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
Well, that's it.
And my life is now complete.
So is it been the most horrible day of your life? No no, I enjoyed it.
I enjoyed driving fast and relatively dangerously.
Well it wasn't fast, coz it was only Well it was very fast for me.
- Was it? - Yes.
Coz I'm very slow, I usually drive with my nose on the windscreen and So you're over here at the moment obviously staring in a play - Yes - In the West End.
So does that mean you're living in London? UmYeah, during the play.
Yeah.
During the play.
And so what are you driving around London, then? A Gewiss - Gewiss, the little electric.
- Yeah.
Nice car, I've always liked them.
I happen to know that's a lie.
No, no, noIt's all just a nonsense, people have misquoted me.
I'm thinking of getting one.
No, well you should, but I don't think you'd fit in it.
That's the problem.
No, I would.
I'd saw bits off.
II'd get in.
Mine's got tiger stripes all over it, it's very attractive as well.
I like that idea, I'd - Now you live in Paris, most of the time.
- Yes.
How does that compare to London? Um, traffic's worse.
Um, I like driving in Paris, I don't like driving in London very much.
It's very different in driving style.
- That you have to adjust - Well , Yeah.
I mean I've got 4 traffic offences in my first week in London.
What the Gewiss? - Yes, a bit, yeah.
- No way.
Obviously not speeding.
- No, that would be difficult.
- No, that would be impossible.
You did once describe driving round the Arc De Triomphe as one of life's great adventures.
Oh, I love it.
It's fantastically frightening.
I did it once in a Ford GT, that was very tricky.
What's a Ford GT? It's aIt's not anot a particularly nice car.
It damages the enviroument quite badly, I don't really like it.
but there is a moment when you just get to the Arc De Triomphe and just think "Here we go!" I love it, it's like It is great fun.
The thing is, the trick with the Arc De Triomphe is you just have to not look where who's coming at you Just look where you're going and have a really badly beaten-up car.
Yeah, no, never try in a nice car, coz Always a worse car you lay your hands on.
coz then everyone would avoid you.
And this is one of the reasons why I've sort of got you as the Cool Wall Muse if you see what I mean, because you do your struggle in Europe.
in Paris, in Europe, to me, it's just so much cooler than Los Angeles and even New York.
But do you mind awfully if I just run a few cars past you? - Yeah.
- Establish their coolness.
This, OK? Obviously this is very cool.
- Yes - Gewiss - What? - That's mine, I haven't got my specs(spectacles) on though.
I'm sorry mate, you discribed it as a "wart" last year.
- No.
- It is beautiful.
It is beautiful.
The only problem that you might find is getting into it.
And at rainy night you have to choose.
Between windscreen wiper and lights You see, that isn't in the brochure.
But I would just like to say that when I said it was a wart I was thinking more in terms of Cindy Crawford's beauty spot.
But I love this car, I absolutely love this car.
It's absolutely brilliant for London.
- So it's very very very cool.
- Thank you very much.
And that's very cool.
Now we've often said on the Cool Wall that we anticipate, coz you live in Paris, that small European cars like those, OK? Renaults and That's a little Citroen and that's a little Fiat.
They're cool, are we right? Yes, I think the Renaults are, Yeah.
- Not what? Not the Fiat? - Not that one.
- The little Renault Clio? - That one's little bit dodgy at the back.
A bit what? dodgy? - Don't like the back at sort of - Yeah now I agree.
Crap, absolutely crap, Fiat Puntos are rubbish, somebody quitely go and move it down.
This is awful.
- And, we've also said this kind of thing, Red Bentley - I love that.
Show it to me.
How do you feel now? I may have accidentaly said in the past it was a Chelsea footballer's car that.
But it is! But that's cool.
But it's fabulous.
I took a chainsaw to it last week, you're machineguning it.
Right, Good.
Red Bentley will do.
I don't really like those.
Yes, I moved them all down last week.
I use to had one and I got rid of it.
Did you? which did you have? I had a really nice one, it was a big VolvoUm something.
XC90? - I have no idea that.
It was just - I've got one of those.
you know those really huge ones? - Yeah.
- I liked it.
There are seven seats in it.
- Yes, that's right.
- That's what I've got.
Born in the same year.
Don't, thank you.
As Richard Hammond.
ButGot out of that one.
Just, right.
Can I just say, Rolls-Royce? Emm, I am sort of slightly ambivalent about Rolls-Royce.
Yeah, Richard Hammond came down in one this morning.
What? That is lying.
- Think you've made up a bit fool of yourself then mate.
- This is desperate.
I told you shouldn't have done.
Right now, most important, Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder.
- This is yeah.
- What? It's pathetic, isn't it? Yeah! Anybody's got a knife? Right so cancel that.
- What? order? - Yes So you've got one of these? No.
I thought you'd have a Volvo, like a sensible person.
- A what? - A Volvo.
No, the children go around in a Volvo.
Obviously because they're going to school in back.
I have to have something else, and I thoughtthat would berubbish.
And I I don't know what Now if I may, we'll move on, coz you're over here staring in the "Seagull"? - In the "Seagull".
- Chekhov play.
Now, "Seagull" is not about a seagull.
No, do you want to know what's it about? Well, I think, I mightcan I just guess? Does it see act 1, not much happens, and act 2 not much, then act 3 Everything happens.
Well, it's in between the acts somebody goes off and tries to shoot himself in the head and misses It misses.
That's when everyone's in the bar and then he come back he's got a bandage on his head.
- Now this is completely sold out - Yeah Can't get tickets and God knows I've tried.
Have you got a thing about Chekhov? I just really like ChekhovNo, I haven't got a thing about Chekhov.
But I just find that I've only done two plays, am I boring you already? "Jezza loves Kristin" That's so sweet.
It's not, it's pathetic.
I'm touched.
Anybody wants a job presenting Top Gear the address is BBC Wood Lane London W12 7TS Now, we're going to find out obviously in a minute, how your lap was.
Do you wanna tell us how it went? There was a bit of boggy moment, wasn't it? Did you get off? I went off and sank.
- Really? - Yes.
And I saw an ambulance coming speeding towards me Not to rescue me but just tow the car out of the Did you get it too fast or get lost? No, I just sort of gave up steering.
Well, I tell you what, who'd like to see the lap? I'm one.
Ok, let's play the tape.
Parisian start.
- En, looks good.
- I sing.
No this is smooth and perfect in everywhere, I can't see anything wrong with that.
And into Chicago, and again, no, absolutely bang-on.
Hugh Grant did that And that was my favourite part break hard enoughBloody hell.
And then watch this, I can see where you've been off there.
It's awfully muddy.
Now here, did you go fast.
.
flat-out through here? No I tried, but it's quite difficult.
No that't flat-out, I can hear the tires tortured screamingOh look at that.
- Oh that was me? - I know.
Is this the fastest you've ever gone? That's not very fast.
And now, here we are, across the line, perfect! Now Where do you think you might have come? - Where do you? - Probably Brian What down here? What? Brian Cox? I don't know, I have no idea, I have no idea of what time it was You did it in 1:54 - There.
-Thank you.
Now Faster than Philip Glenister, faster than Rick Wakeman faster than Brian Cox and much faster than Jimmy Carr.
I have to say I thought that you were better at that than I would be in a Chekhov play.
That'sYes, that'll be.
It's been an absolute pleasure having you here as I'm sure you're gonna appreciate.
Ladies and gentlemen, Kristin Scott Thomas.
Now, this is a super car.
It's built primarily to be fast.
But above super cars there is another level.
Hyper cars.
And those are mostly about showing off.
Which is what you were doing in that interview.
- A bit.
- You have let the program down, you let yourself down.
- Sorry mate.
We're just - Embarrassment.
Anyway He does have a point, OK? Super cars are designed to mess with G Forces, Hyper cars are designed to mess with G Strings.
And king of the hyper car makers has always been Lamborghini.
Yeah.
So cars like the Diablo, the Countach, they were brilliant cars to look at.
They all made you feel like you're 10 years old.
But the fact is they were always horrid to drive.
No, they were.
They were designed for Rod Stewart, not Jackie Stewart.
So, you're probably expecting more of the same from the latest product.
The Murcielago LP640 Here it is.
And of course it's very dramatic.
It's also very large and it turns a great many heads as you drive along.
Plus, it makes a lot of noise.
But if you actually look at it, it's not that outlandish.
It was actually styled by a Belgium.
Same chap who did the Audi A2 and there are no big spoilors spreading out of it.
There're no rotating knives.
There aren't even any machine guns.
The vents only open when the engine gets really hot the rest of the time they are hiden away.
There is a gaint oil cooling aperture on one side of the car.
But instead of fitting a fake on the other, they haven't botherd.
There is no style for style sake here.
And look at the exhaust pipe.
It's the same width as the channel tunnel.
But there is only one.
Not 17 like you get in most hyper cars.
You even get a device that raises the nose for going over speed humps.
This is all fine.
But what is the point of a Lamborgini that doesn't have space thruster sticking out of the side? Of course, you still get scissor doors and when you step inside you find the steering wheel isn't quite in front of where you're sitting.
But there is room for your head.
And you can see out.
Can even see behind! Then when you're driving along normally, it feels very civilized.
I mean obviously it's not a Honda Civic.
You can't turn left for example, coz the indicator stalk'll hit your knee.
And it does 8 miles to the gallon.
or four.
But that's set you don't have to raise your voice to have a conversation.
It's got satellite navigation and it's got air-conditioning.
Which unlike the air-conditioning systems in Lambos of all it isn't like being coughed on by a mouse.
This is all very worrying.
You see it's 8 years since Captain Sensibles of Audi took over Lamborghini.
And now they seems to be taking away its soul.
The only reason we ever liked Lamborghinis is because they were silly.
Taking that away is like taking away the sunshine from a Summer holiday.
You're left with nothing.
Except for one thing.
Audi have replaced the lunacy with something else.
They've increased the size of the V12 from 6.
2 to 6.
5 litres.
But what it delivers is simply staggering.
then you get 500 carbon dioxides and 640 BHP That's more than you get from a Porsche Carrera GT or a Mclaren Mercedes SLR it's more than you get from a Zonda.
The result is spectacular.
This is not a light car, but my God it's fast.
Properly, savagely fast.
The top speed is 200 and Tell you what, let's find out.
fastest anything's gone down here is about 190.
That's 200, we're quicker than anything ever.
Look at that.
207! Of course figures like these are sort of meaningless.
They're hard to get your head drown So what I've done, is organized a demostration.
What we have here is a Golf GTI And what we are going to do now is have a half mile drag race To show the difference between a fast car and the Murcielago.
Ok now this has Formula 1 style launch control What you do is hit the sport buttonMurcielago Turn the traction control off and then floor the throttle.
when the revs hit 4000 the clutch will bang in.
and we'll be off.
Here we go! Wow coughed on.
Big Wow.
.
Now you might imagine that this sort of power doesn't come cheap.
and there is some evidence to support that if you look at the options list.
That little bit of carbon fibre there on the center console Carbon breaks, 7,780 pounds.
If you want those break calipers, these things, you want those painting That's 600 pounds.
Err.
.
transparent engine cover, you see that on the back.
flappy paddle gearbox, 6,250.
You'd need a flappy paddle head to spend that.
All those are just But amazingly the actual car only costs 190,000 pounds.
That's about half of what you pay for a normal hyper car.
So, it's quite well priced.
It's hugely powerful.
and it's surprisingly elegant.
But do not, for one minute, be tricked into thinking that the king of the hyper cars has become a super car.
In the twisty stuff it's still a card-carrying lunatic.
You take one liberty with it and trust me on this, You are going down.
Here we go, into neutral, and we're going backwards.
So, it's still really a car for show off so not driving then.
It's kind of half way.
You see the thing is, if you're in a super car.
and you go out there and you reach the limit you know, the limit of grip, and it'll start to slide.
and you can hold that slide coz you're on the air field it doesn't matter.
This, 4-wheel-drive, so you've got tons of grip.
tons and tons, and then when you get to the limit It's off.
It's a really dim witted 4-wheel-drive system somehow.
It's just, you cannot push it beyond the limit.
So you can't really drive it to the limit because Or anywhere near the limit.
The punishment then for just over doing it by 1 percent is certain death.
Absolutely, emm, happyly however.
We have a man on the team, who laughs in the face of death.
Some say that he sucks the moisture from ducks.
And that his crash helmet is modelled on Britney Spear's head, all we know is, he's called the Stig.
And he's off, now show off or not? This is still a fiercely quick car.
The question is, can it knock the Koenigsegg off the top of our lap board.
Seeming it doesn't bite Stig in the face on the way.
So going OK so far.
Radio: The love making was hesitant and tender.
He didn't hurt or frighten her she'd feared.
More romantic fiction dribble there as he powers round Chicago keeping it very tidy, which he has to do Coz you can't stick the tail out.
Here he comes into Hammerhead.
Yes look at that, he's absolutely keeping it on the raggedy edge.
Radio: But the most beautiful part of all was her smile.
Right let's see what the what the Lambo can do now.
This is it, this is where it can unleash that fearsome fire power.
coming down into the tires here.
That is quick even moving the camera.
Two corners left.
Ok, chucks it in, right on the limit of grip now.
belt up to Gambon, turning in Look at that, keeping the tail in check and across the line.
Where do you think he came? - Fourth.
- Fourth? Not fourth.
Not fourth.
It camemmm there, look at there ladies and gentlemen Second, fourth sixth place! The sixth fastest car That's a hyper car! Now, from last year we decided to grow our own petrol.
and earlier on in the show, you saw us testing 3 tractors to decide which one would be best for the job.
And we couldn't decide, so we took all three.
Yes, we had the tractors and now it was time to start farming.
This is BBC Radio 4.
Now, it's Farming Today this week Good morning.
A new report This is the 25-acre field where we'll be growing us first crop of Top Gear petrol.
We had just 1 day to get it sewn and immediately, there was a problem.
Before we could start ploughing this lot would have to be evicted.
So how do you clear sheep? Call Fred Dibnah.
He is dead.
Not Dibnah is it? It's Fred Drabble You mean Phil Drabble.
He's dead as well.
So what shall we do? Could use dynamite.
Eventually, the job was given to Hammond and Top Gear dog.
TG, run at them.
Come on.
TG, come on.
Who didn't seem to be in the mood.
TG, come.
TG, come here.
This is just me doing it.
This is stupid.
TG, come Meanwhile, James and I set about the complexities of the day.
There, it's really very simple.
Our rented field is 25 acres big.
It's a field where we currently filming one dog and its man.
TG, just round one up.
And we're gonna plant this, it's oilseed rape.
And when it's harvested, we should get 15 tons of rape seed oil.
Yeah, and what we are gonna do is rent a cycle-distilling machine, isn't it? - Yeah.
- And anyone can do that.
And then we'll convert those 15 tons into 3,000 gallons of petrol.
And that's enough to get my Ford GT to the shops and back.
Absolutely.
And it's also enough to drive a typical family car what, 90,000 miles? No, just go the other way! That way! - Hammond.
- Hurry up.
- That's a useless dog.
- He is useless.
Not one.
Eventually the sheep were cleared by a proper dog.
So we could get going with our tractors.
But that gave us another problem.
Guys, is this the only way into the field? It was.
And it wasn't exactly the work of Brunel.
Nevertheless, James crept over slowly and carefully in his Fendt.
And then I went over in my sports tractor.
Floor it.
So fast that I broke it.
This seemed to annoy Hammond.
This weighs 24 tons.
You've broken it with half of that.
I will see if Wait a moment.
Would you just grab that Then we made things worse.
Avoid that there.
Who chose this field? We spent ages trying to help him.
Got it.
Oh, forget it, May.
It at least weighs half a ton.
- I can't even lift it at this end.
- Is it oak? Can you just go to this side and avoid that bit.
Of course May, yeah.
I'll go on one side of the weak bridge.
Come on.
If he falls in, I'm going to die laughing.
To avoid the broken slipper, I had to go right over the edge.
I can't see anything.
I've no idea what it's doing.
Straight for a bit.
OK.
Straight comes, come forwards.
Don't, stop, stop.
Piece of cake.
Now, we were in the field.
Our first job was to plough it.
And Hammond had gone for some machinery from, I think, Battlestar Galactica.
Have you seen the size of my plough.
Oh, yeah! Not feel this is the right weather for ploughing.
Because our training at the track, we had no trouble getting the ploughs hitched.
And then we got into our ploughing positions.
Right, we've divided the field up into 3 equal parts, each of us gets two telegraph poles.
Yes, then we're gonna see who can do their ploughing the fastest.
No, we are gonna see who can do it the best.
And because we don't know anything about ploughing, we've invited some ploughing judges who judge ploughing.
And they explain to James just what they've been looking for.
Every furrow, absolutely identical in every way we're looking for all the trash to be buried, we're looking for no dips and mounts.
A good seed bed for the next crop.
You sound like a Yorkshireman, are you? I am a Yorkshireman, Yeah.
I used to live in Yorkshire, where about? I'm Doncaster.
Jeremy Clarkson is from Doncaster.
He is from Doncaster.
In fact I know his mother very well.
- Do you? - I knew him.
When he was in school.
So you like him? I wouldn't say I like himWell.
We were ready to plough.
Here we go.
I'm ploughing.
Here we go! Difflock one, difflock two, Oil to plough.
This is gonna be the fastest piece of ploughing ever.
That's No.
2 plough So I was struggling with my robot plough James was trundling along like Worzel Gummidge.
and Jeremy was going like a bat with no sense of direction at all.
Oh, yeah, this is easy now.
The judges were not impressed.
March for straightness, 0 to 10, a half? Still, at least I was doing better than James.
What's he doing? May, You imbecile, you've got the entire earth stuck to the back of your plough.
Meanwhile, Richard had finally set off in the starship and to plough.
But the moment he tried to turn around, disaster.
I've sheared a bolt.
That's bad.
You've done nothing.
So, This is down to me.
The sports tractor is the only one who can do this job.
Seen the size of the bolts I've sheared? You've sheared the bolts? Oh Bolt one.
With James' tractor beached and Hammond's broken, mine was the only one still running.
It's half past 1 in the afternoon, and I frankly can't see us getting this done in a week.
If we were going to get our crop planted by the end of the day, I was going to have to break out my ingenuity and use a method of ploughing they certainly wouldn't think of on the archers Fire in the hole.
What?! Good! Ploughing done.
With our farming back on schedule, we could afford to have a spot of lunch.
and that sparked one of the great debates of the country side.
Never mind that.
What's in the ploughman's Cheese, it's always cheese.
- It's Cheddar.
- Yes.
Still, no, could be Stilton.
No, you can't have Oh, I can't stand ploughman's with ponsy cheese.
How could you have called Stilton ponsy.
They are the least ponsy cheese in the world.
Stale bread, hard Chadder, and a pickle of some sort, that's all they'd have - Apple.
- Farm Only in season.
And the apple season coincides with the ploughing season you pillock.
Pickled onions, Branston Pickle, an apple - Cheese, get all both sorts.
I don't want to have a row with him.
- Chadder or StiltonOK - Lettuce.
- No, lettuce Eventually we made a decision and Hammond was nominated to go off and buy our lunch.
I haven't got a car, I can't.
You have to use your tractor.
Wait a minute.
14th's a bit of a sharp gear and it really goes! With Hammond's 24-ton runabout bearing down on the nearest village, James and I set about on our next job: cultivating, breaking up the ploughed soil.
And this demanded some serious tractor customizing.
I don't like the look of that sky.
Not for cultivating.
Meanwhile in the local village, Hammond was blending in nicely.
Hello, it's a bit tight.
Oh, got alarms going off.
Sorry, sorry.
James was as much use at cultivating as he had been at ploughing.
James, what're you doing? I'm doing my pre-cultivating checks, thank you, Jethro.
I think this is the first thing we've ever filmed, while I can do it and those two can't.
I've hit the telegraph pole.
James, I'm begging you now to just drive the tractor into the field to do cultivating.
Mercy, James, mercy, just for one Right, two hydraulic tubes, top link attached.
Come on, come down.
One side of the fence or the other.
Ploughman's lunch.
Stilton or Chadder? Stilton.
You see.
James May you talking rubbish.
Ploughman's lunch is Oh that's a bus.
I sensed that the locals had had enough.
But before I left town, I had to fill up with fuel.
Back at the field, James finally joined me and together we finished the cultivating.
Then we were ready to start planting the rape seed, but since one bag would be enough to do the whole 25 acres, only one of us could do it.
And annoyingly, James insisted it had to be him.
Bro, are we finished now? Err, 1127 pounds.
And to add insult to poverty, when I got back, my ploughman's was snubbed.
A crusty French loaf is what I asked for.
That's a French apple as well.
After lunch, is was time for the final job.
The seeding machine was incredibly complicated, but James insisted that after 4 hours of pre-seeding checks he was up to the job.
and we don't need that, because we got that.
That's good.
- James, do you know what you're doing? - Yes.
No, listen, stop.
Stop, please, listen.
You've got Because slugs and pigeons are going to eat half all the seeds you plant, You've got to make sure that you plant 70, that's that many, - 70 per square yard.
- Right.
This is it.
The moment.
Our petrol is going to be planted.
Here we go.
Seeding.
Oh, for god's sake.
James.
Is that it? He's done the whole bloody lot.
It's 25 acres, and they're in 25 square inches.
May, you're gonna die! I'm gonna feed you into your own machine.
You were useless in farming words He didn't understand seasons, he didn't understand cheese.
And then all your seed fell on the fellow ground.
I knew you were an onanist.
Well, in fairness, they did make me go back and do all that again all through the night until my seed was evenly distributed in every furrow I can find.
And next year, we are going to harvest that making it into delicious petrol.
Absolutely.
And then we'll be green and rich.
But that's it for tonight.
Thank you very much for watching.
Next week, we make our own stretch limos which well doesn't go that well.
But anyway, we'll see you then.
Good night!

<|endoftext|>

Tonight, we cut some cars in half with saws.
Richard smokes a horse.
And who is in our reasonably priced car? Oh, it's his assistant.
Hello, hello and welcome.
Thank you very much.
Now, we start tonight with stretch limousines.
There are 9,000 of the damn things in Britain and they are all American cars that have been elongated and then coated with a sort of veneer of velour.
Why? Why can't limos be based on normal cars that we can buy in Britain? I mean, how hard can it be? Well, to find out, we were all three asked to build our own limousines.
The recipe is simple.
Find a car, anything we liked, cut it in half, and then put an extra bit in the middle.
What could possibly go wrong? This is what I'm gonna base my limo on.
Yes, it's a 1993 1L Fiat Panda CLX.
Now the interesting thing about this car is under the bonnet it doesn't have an engine.
What you get instead is a small field mouse called Gerald.
Break down baby.
Ah, if Gerald runs around this wheel really very very fast he'll get me from 0-60 in 18 seconds.
Don't worry though.
There's method in my madness.
Why start off with a big car when you're gonna make it big anyway.
And why have a big thirsty engine when you're gonna spend most of your time in town doing ten miles an hour, and if you put your foot down, everyone in the back is gonna spill their /.
My limo will be based on this, a sensible Saab 9000 3L V6 You're thinking: "there goes, Caption Slow and I expect he'll do a really good job of turning it into a limousine coz let's face it, he's a bit boring.
" Hahaha You can not even begin to comprehend the band of my forthcoming genius.
For my limo, I've thought of a bit luxury up.
It's a MGF, which as you've probably noticed is a two-seater at the moment.
Coz what I plan to create here is quite possibly the world's first mid-engined roadster limousine.
Nobody has done it before and I don't understand why not.
Why shouldn't "hen nights" have their wind-in-the-hair open top thrill.
So we'd all got our cars and we'd all found people who were going to help us turn them into limos.
This is the very same workshop where we made our convertible people carrier.
And that worked.
This job though, would require much more precision.
Right, where are my hammers? Meanwhile, in my workshop, my genius plan was to make the Saab with a second car.
And here it is.
It's an Alfa Romeo 164 3L V6.
And I know it seems odd, but think about it, No one ever said that the two ends of the stretch limo had to come from the same car.
I'd picked some motorsports specialists to help with the sports limo There are a few concerns largely coz the engine is pretty much at the back.
So all things like these radiator pipes and the gearbox linkage from the front to the back and the throttle controls they are all gonna have to be sort of made longer.
Right, this is the really clever bit.
Although the Saab and the Alfa look very different, underneath, they got the same floor pan.
And more importantly, as my center lines show, the wheel base is exactly the same.
It'll be sensible and Swedish at one end and fiery and Italian at the back.
It is a Salfa Romeab.
Here is a Top Gear top tip Rent one of these 35 quid a day.
Somebody you don't like very much, cut their car in half.
My first job was to cut all the pipes leading to the engine.
Oh, that went really really well.
That's disconnected.
When do you think you're gonna cut it in half? I'm not gonna get into a cutting-in-half competition with you, mate.
Coz I know exactly what you're gonna do.
What am I gonna do? Make a mess of it.
Oh, that's not a good time.
- Hello.
- Hamster.
Oh, bugger! Yes? How is it going? Really well, actually.
You know what James has got? - Yeah.
- A Saab.
- No, he's got an Alfa.
- No, it's a Saab.
No, it's an Alfa.
he's got an Alfa.
But he definitely told me he's got a Saab.
- So he doesn't know what car he has got.
- He doesn't even know what he's bought.
Is it true that Jeremy has bought a Fiat Panda? Yeah.
I mean if you're gonna make a stretch car, why would you start with a Fiat Panda? You can stretch it a mile and it's still only gonna be as bigg as a normal car.
Well have you met Jeremy Clarkson big tall fella, curly hair, idiot.
That's your answer, really, isn't it? Finally, it was time to cut our cars in half.
- What're you doing? - Cut it in half.
That's what half way, mate.
That's about half way.
I'm not gonna measure it.
Where are you gonna put you seats? Where is all the strength? OK? It's alright, I'll weld that bit up.
Inevitably James was being scientific about the project and was sawing his car in half using a plasma cutter.
Now watch this.
I do know what I'm doing.
I've made a bit of a plate.
And I'm gonna weld it over the little the little hole there and you'll never know the difference.
By using patience and math to make my limo, I was doing a damn sight better than Hammond.
Bad, bad thing.
Sorry.
It's locked, I can't get in.
The car is burning down before I've even built it.
That's bad, that's bad.
Jeremy had similar problems and couldn't even understand how the fire extinguisher works.
Good coz i have ahave a pull the safety pins.
That's fire.
Eventually the fires were put out and by tea time Richard's car was in half.
There it is! Shortly afterwards, mine was unconjoined as well.
Be hold the broken car.
and with James' Saab predictably still in one piece, I decided to make sure that mechanically at least my little Fiat had survived the operation.
And I'm delighted to say it had.
Obviously, we'll be picking that up later on.
But now, it's time to do the news.
And we begin, well, actually, we begin with last week.
Because you mocked me for wearing a suit.
You may remember this, yes? Because Kristin Scott Thomas was down here.
Tuesday, he walked into the office dressed like this.
- Yeah, alright.
- Look at him.
Where'd you been? I've been invited to No.
10 to a one-on-one chat with Prime Minister.
So I've, you know, put on a suit.
You say you going down there, you were in No.
10 Yeah.
- Sitting with him? - Yeah.
Did you vomit on him? No, you can't you can't vomit on the Prime Minister, mate.
Well, you can.
If you had a load of cheese soup before you get there, and then lots of salt water, all over him.
You could easily have done that.
- You didn't.
- No.
I didn't.
- Did you punch him in the face? - No.
No.
I didn't vomit on or punch the Prime Minister in the face, OK? How close were you to him, at any one point.
I was sitting next to him.
Look, there is a picture hang on, there, you see? That's it.
You could have easily punched him in the face from there, you idiot.
/ sick.
Look/ you just shed all over his leg and his cuff links.
No, look, I, that's Those are the two things that you're best at in the world.
Being sick and punching people.
He came around your house once, didn't he? Yes.
One time you came to my house, you vomited all over my sofa.
Sorry about that.
My house, vomited all over me.
I did do that.
So you vomited all over you mates, why couldn't you vomit over him? I'm sorry.
He'd invited me around for a chat.
So it wasn't appropriate About what? About road pricing.
And what did he say? That we need to do something about congestion.
Well did you tell him if he got rid of the bloody M4 bus lane, that might help? Did you tell him that? I didn't say that.
I wasn't sick.
I Did you tell him to get rid of the speed humps? No.
Did you tell him to up the speed limit on the motorway to 150? Coz that will surely Did you tell him that? Alright! I Punch him in the face! I let you down, lads.
I'm sorry.
Because, ok, road pricing is coming, and it's his fault.
I now realize I've let you down and I'm sorry.
You see, it's not us.
You've let everybody down here.
You've let him down.
He can't even afford proper clothes.
You could've been the first person in British history to punch the Prime Minister in the face and be sick on him, let him Alright.
I'll be the first person to punch you in the face on TV.
Now, that's more like it.
Why couldn't you do that to him? - Can we move on? - Yes, we can move on.
Now there's a new um Mondeo coming out in June.
and I've got a picture of it here.
and it will be brilliant.
It will.
Well the last one was.
It was brilliant to everything.
It looks fantastic.
A couple of things I think it's got a bit too much mascara around its headlamps.
No, you need it.
I had a bit of that going on in the studio last week actually.
The makeup lady put too much, err Hang on.
You were wearing mascara? Well, it's whatever the makeup lady puts on us before we walk in.
She Yes, I guess so.
I don't know.
You let her.
Oh for crying out Well you let her make you look like a "spaniel" every week.
Alright, I just want to get back to the car.
If you may The other thing is I've looked this engine's spec It's 1.
8s and diesels and 2 Liters.
There is no hot one.
Remember the days of the Cortina? There was the Lotus Cortina.
The Sierra, there was the Sierra Cosworth There's no hot version of this Coz what you want is like a Mondeo Vindaloo Actually, what if they just name the whole range after curries, depending on how hot they are.
- Yeah, that's - That's a good idea.
That's not of a bad idea.
You could do like / do those little chilies on the back, then I could have the / freezy.
Yeah, he could have the corma/.
Yeah, fast enough for me.
I really do like that idea.
Coz you''re bring together sort of two great British institutions.
Indian food and a car made in Belgium - Hahaha - Yeah.
Now, you know that new law about kids under four foot five They have to use booster seats in a car.
- He does.
- Yes, alright.
- I just knew it.
- Alright.
People under four foot five have to use a booster seat in a car.
But in North Yorkshire, the police say they can't enforce that law, do you know why? They do not have the heiheihei They do not have the legal heiheihei I can't wait for this now.
The legal Because they do not have the legal right to measure children.
Just imagine Just if you see the policemen measuring your children, you think "quick, call the" So they'll have to do what they used to do then they just put up some new sort of camera by the road to monitor children in cars to make sure No, no, you can't video children.
Have you ever been to school sports day? You have to ask every parent in there before they let you take your camera out of boot.
Oh go to your own kids' sports day, maybe they will let you Err, right, moving on.
- You know Aston Martins for sale? - Yeah.
But I can't understand coz Ford the only profitable part of the whole Ford business is Aston Martin and they decided to sell it.
But anyway, the leading bid at the moment is from an Egyptian consortium Carpets will be nice.
Really really labro/, really labro/.
Yeah, then buying one is gonna be interesting.
You get down to my brother's Abdulla Martin shop.
Hahaha.
- For you, my friend.
- I make my special price.
special price.
Right, now, you probably know, the Vauxhall Monaro, one of our favorite cars and we were very disappointed when they stopped making it.
Yes, but now it's back and we've got one here.
It's now called the VXR 8.
Fantastic looking thing.
It's got gills down here like a fish and it's now got four doors instead of two.
Absolutely brilliant this.
But it still got the same engine.
So that's a huge 6L V8 that develops 414 bhp Yeah, but you can get a supercharger kit for it.
Which takes it up to 540 bhp.
But the best thing about it is the value for money coz the standard car's got 414 same as an Audi RS4 - Yeah.
- But it costs 35,000 pounds.
That's 15,000 cheaper.
I know, we love the Audi.
Make no mistake.
I think the Audi is a very polite car.
This is more of a yobbo really.
This should come with like two butt cheeks on the back, so everyone behind is being mooned.
Now, earlier on you saw us buy some old cars and set about turning them into stretched limousines.
Next, we were told to report to the Top Gear test track on a bitterly cold day where we would be given a number of challenges.
Well, here it is.
My sports limo.
Proof that style does not have to be slow.
It is genius.
This time, once and for all , I'm going to win.
I shall be victorious.
Oh my god! It's a giant panda.
Never before bred in captivity.
That is a big panda.
It is.
Coz this is an economical limo.
- It'sit's justit's my sports limo, mate.
- Can we justdo you mind? The first thing I saw obviously, was the spoiler.
It's proportional to the car.
You need downforce? Do you need that in this? No, but it's part of image.
And image is everything.
- Can we also say, you've no roof? - Yeah, I have.
Hathat's it.
Well it was complicated.
That's it.
There is a gap.
There are tolerances here.
You could only work to so much.
Then May turned up and boy were we in for a shock.
Hang on.
Now that, that I didn't expect.
I'm confused.
Well, can I just explain? It's all about choice, OK? At the front, it's a sensible Swedish Saab 9000, another front, it's a sporty and stylish Italian Alfa Romeo.
What kind of paint thinner were you sniffing in when you thought of this? That theme, style, sensibleness, Sweden, Italy, I've continued that on the inside.
Because at this end, it is a sauna.
- Does it work? - No.
And at the other endare you ready? It is The Sistine Chapel.
Can you drive it both ways? Both cars? Yes.
That's the brilliant thing about it.
Because what's the problem with a limousine? The Movability.
- What? - Maneuverability.
No, I'm fine on that.
- You may have an issue.
- No, you have that obviously.
It's the very thin.
Our first task was to test out each other's cars and we began with the panda's brilliant passenger entry system.
Have you two ever seen the Great Escape? I mean it's perfectly straight forward, look.
This pulley.
You lie on this, OK? And Britney Spears is gonna do that, yeah? This is ideal really for people who used to be miners.
I thought you had sniffed thinners making that.
James offered to join me in the back.
Here he comes.
It's a ingenious solution to a problem that should never existed in the first place.
Next, I introduced Hammond to the in-car communications.
This is an intercom system.
And it's hands free.
So if you put that thing around your neck, it's like a one-man-band thing So it it's legal.
This isn't the most elegant solution.
I've literally thought of everything.
Right, I'm pulling away.
Hold on tight.
Here we go, going to beach.
You'll notice you swing around it, it doesn't have quite that same responsiveness.
Running out of run way.
Oh no, I I'm sorry, I'm on the field a bit.
You see the slags take some of the jolting out of it.
What have you done? You've gone over a runway light you blithering idiot.
Yeah, right, you made the car a mile long.
It's hardly my fault.
Even on our 160-foot wide runway, maneuverability was an issue.
But we did at least find a new way of speeding up my passenger entry and exit system.
Here we go.
Britney Clarkson is leaving the car.
OK, we are arriving, I'll brake.
You're a comp, it's an all over carpet burn.
How am I gonna explain this to my wife? Next, we try James' Alfaab.
James, a bit of an issue I've got here.
- What? - Head room.
There is loads of it.
What's your problem? He's put a sauna in this end and he's put it on the roof.
- Your beer fountain -Yes.
It's just making me want to pee.
But as problems go, that was nothing.
What's this stick? No no, don't pull that.
What you've donewhat's happened? - Hammond's unlocked the steeringin the wrong end, you idiots.
- Sorry.
/ To try and regain control of the rear, Hammond dived for the wheel of the Alfa.
Not that way! - Is that helping? - No.
I'll go the other way.
Hang on.
It's bad for the sauna.
Oh myha! - No - James - Stop.
- How the hell You pair of utter pillocks.
You've ruined my car.
You've been If I was driving it like a limousine, and you two were just being yobbos trying to break everything, that wouldn't happen.
The engineering in James' limo hadn't fared well.
So, time to try out Hammond's convertible.
Where is the heater? Well that is a problem.
Coz the engine of course is at the back and the pipes are It hasn't got one.
You're the stupidest man I've ever met.
I'll tell you what though.
Your car is a rubbish.
- I'll tell you what though.
- You put the roof up then.
Mind your head, mind you head, mind your head.
Oh, you see? It's no better with the roof up.
If anything it catches is the breeze I think.
Oh, that's gone.
That does happen.
How do I tell James to slow down? Oh, that's brilliant.
We call him on this.
What? Tell him to just slow down? Could you slow down a little, please, driver? James? Yes, what do you want? Can you see us? Yes, yeah, very funny.
To warm up a bit, Hammond suggested we try some of his onboard sports equipment.
Yeah, go.
Yes! The other thing that Hammond has done, is that he has fixed the seat in his driveAh! Hahaha With our test drives over, it was time for the challenges to begin.
Not all limo drivers are drug dealers, not all limos are used for hen nights, some have to be used for transporting political figures who may be attacked any time.
Your cars then should be nimble and fast enough to get out of tricky spots.
Well, that's you in trouble, what is it? For the first challenge, you arrive at a road block, the other two presenters are there armed with paint ball guns.
How many hits can they score before you've done a J turn and got away.
He is in a convertible.
Oh no, I have not thought of that.
I was first to drive into the jaws of death.
Oh no, a pathetic road block.
Now, a J turn.
You reverse at high speed, brake, spin the wheel, and as the front slues around, you slam it into first and roar away.
I must be honest Oh wait, now this is the panda wasn't much good.
It's actually quite tiring, isn't it? Yeah, just on the trigger thing.
Yes, I may be geting shot a few times now.
Ah Yeah, quite a lot.
Yeah, youmay have You could get more paint on it if you use the brush.
With my panda having set the bar pretty low, the convertible went next.
Hope you don't mind the mask, but there is no roof.
Hope I don't meet any terrorists Oh no, terrorists! Do your J turn then.
The speed was good, the protection, not so good.
Ah, that's a shot in the head.
But I got one there and one there.
Did it hurt? Yes, like ayou know, hurt like a Like a word you can't.
.
a paint ball in the head, yes.
Yeah, unfortunately, I suspect I think I've beaten you.
you have beaten me.
- Right, James, good luck.
- Good luck.
Instead of doing the tricky J turn, I planned to get into the Alfa end and reverse away forwards.
But that idea did have a flaw.
In fact, it had two flaws.
Oh the wheel wont Oh, look.
I don't know.
You aimed at my gentleman's area.
That was chafing agony.
There is far more on you than on your car.
- Yeah, well, so in that case, I've won.
- No, no.
I know, hang on, the rule said But in the real situation, will you be thinking "Never mind, at least my car has not got paint on it!" The rule said hits on the car, not hits on the wedding vegetables.
It was time for the next challenge.
I just hope that that was the end of evasive driving stuff.
Evasive driving part 2: It's a test of nippiness against the clock.
You break out from a terrorists' trap, slalom down the runway between strategically placed cars belonging to members of the public which you may not hit, steering around the stinger at the Hammerhead and pull up once you're out of the range of the water cannon.
The what? With maneuverability being the key to every aspect of this challenge, James was feeling confident.
Watch this.
No, hang on.
- What the hell.
- He's still unlocked now.
How was he going to do a slalom.
It's not gonna help at all.
It's Hammerhead.
The water cannon kicked in to make missing the stinger even harder.
Easy victory.
Well, maybe not.
My sports limo was like a greyhound out of the trap.
Oh, wheel spin and everything! That looks quite good.
I can't really see / now ever having got into it in the first place.
It's the stinger next.
No, hang on, it's the water thing first.
Convertible, as it turns out, not the best idea.
The panda broke out with ease.
Yeah.
Rock and roll.
How can he do the slalom with a car that long? Looking good.
He is gonna to have to take the world's most enormous route.
Oh, for crying out now.
Oh no, I'm not gonna make it.
No, that's such a poor idea.
No.
Oh, there is some smoke coming out of it.
- Oh doesn't that break your heart? - Yeah.
Hey you, the clock is still running.
My limo had become bogged down.
But the film crew kindly pushed me out and I was on my way again.
No, you can squirt it as much as you like.
Sadly, I hit the stinger which punctured the tires and then worse, my engine died.
That was sad.
- Why? - What? Well I don't understand.
Why did you get out of the car? Well coz it's got puncture and the engine had stopped.
so I thought if I get out, I would be able to change the wheel.
Coz the water cannon was off.
I didn't know they were gonna turn it on again.
Did you seriously think there was you out of the car, the water cannon, How could they not turn it on and hit you? Well, with hindsight you're right.
I should've stayed in the car.
Anyway, that wasn't the final challenge.
There was another one, a big one.
One where we brought the whole of central London to a stand still.
And we'll be showing that to you later on.
- Yeah, can I just ask? - What? Your limo, down one side I saw windows.
On the other side, there were no windows? No, it's paparazzi proof.
So if you got Britney Spears in it, she's forgotten her pants.
As she does.
Which she is prone to do.
And now she's got matching, you know, collar and cuffs.
It's so they could It was on the curb side, there were no windows.
I've thought of everything.
Can I just ask why you shot me in the penis? You did.
You think I could hit that when you were 50 feet away and running.
Anyway it's now time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
My guest tonight is attractive.
Uh, she's futuristic and she's from Swindon, so she's sort of like the Honda Civic.
Ladies and gentlemen, Billie Piper.
How are you? - Do you mind? - I'm alright, thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.
Now this is marvelous.
- You're so much better looking than everybody else.
- Thank you.
And your top's more see through, so I'm really I know, I've just heard about that I've just noticed coz you walked outI thought I'm gonna have to - How bad is it? - It's quite bad.
- But don't worry.
- My bra's see through too, woohoo.
- Is it? Really? No, that's a joke.
No! It is.
Uh anyway, listen, is it true that you wrote your auto-biography - because you heard a biography was coming out? - Yeah.
- I heard somebody else was gonna write one.
- Yeah.
- I was pretty convinced it was gonna be full of crap.
- Yeah.
And so I thought I'd have a go myself.
- Did it come out? The biography, or did you kill it? - Yeah.
No, it came out.
It came out, was it full of crap? I didn't actually look at it, I watched its sales, it didn't do so well, but then nor did mine.
So Didwell it's not like it wasn't full of stuff, not like Wayne Rooney, coz he was about 4 when he wrote his.
- It's true.
Have you read it? - He must have put absolu - Of course I haven't read it.
- Right.
"He was born, grew big in years, kicked football, slept with grandmother", it's not really - It's not, it's not gonna be like yours let's be brutally honest.
- No.
So why have you given up "Doctor Who"? Which is the question most asked by my 8 year old.
Because um it just felt like the right time to go, it's 2 years in Cardiff.
- Oh, you - I know, I know.
I haven't realized.
God I once went there for 2 days.
- I'm going to hell.
- I liked it very much.
No, I just, I just wanted to try some other stuff.
Ok now, just before we move off "Doctor Who", I've got 1 important question: what is the top speed of a Dalek? I'm saying 6 mph? They only do 6? - So you run faster than a Dalek? - I can.
Why are you so scared of them then? They're threatening things.
They're huge.
- Are they huge? - They're about the same size as you.
- I could have one.
- Hahaha Um now is it true, obviously we have to get it across for those you know - um, you know you're married to Chris Evans? - Yeah.
- Is it true he tried to pull you in a Ferrari? - That is true.
Quite a thing, did it work? Well obviously it worked.
It worked, yeah, I married him, 6 months later - What? Because of the Fer - Not because of the Ferrari.
- Um - Not because of the color of his hair obviously, that's I love the color of his hair, I'm a big fan of the "Ginge".
Really? - Yeah.
- Are there any here? - No, we don't let them in, that's it, we're trying to kick them out.
- No.
They smell different, I find.
But he's covered it withdidn't he cover the Ferrari with roses? Yeah, he filled the car with roses and then he covered the bonnet with roses, too.
Did he keep it? Um no we chopped it in for 3 classic cars.
Which were? - Um Moggie Minor, Jaguar Mark II, beautiful.
- Yeah.
And a Mercedes, but I can't remember what it was - An old one? - An old one.
- Do you prefer old cars to the? - Yeah, I love old cars.
Why do youold cars what? I just think they're beautiful.
They're works of art.
I'd much rather look at an old car.
I have I'm not a huge fan of new cars at all.
So what's your car now? It's a Porsche 911 Oh God.
Not another one.
- 1989.
- So an early one.
- It's a nice model.
- It's a 1989 Porsche 911? - Yeah.
For people who can careless what model number? - Yeah I don't really know.
- It doesn't really matter, does it? All I know is that it's it's white and I love white cars.
- Now that's interesting.
- Do you like white cars? I think white's a good 70's color that should be making a come back soon.
You are a woman of course of great taste coz I did find a piece of uh writing the day that said you like a man with a beer belly? I do.
HahahaSmug.
- Yeah I do.
- But you neveryou thought the six-pack thing isn't for you? It's not for me.
I don't like it at all.
- Why? - It's just too try hard.
- It's justYou know I like men you know.
- I agree.
Yeah, I bet you're feeling like a bit of a berk now, aren't you? He's been standing there you know that thing men do with the pushing their arms out.
Look at him.
he's like "look at my muscles here, look at that".
They're very nice.
- Now stick your stomach out, you aren't be able to share it, are you? - That's perfect.
Anyway I wanna talk about your lap, how was it out there? UmI wasit was ok.
It was a lot harder than I imagined, I got a bit angry as well which I don't think is good.
- Angry with the Stig? - Myself, not with the Stig, - I love the Stig.
He was very patient, very generous.
- Really? - Verywas he? - Yeah, hahaha - It's just unfortunate that he's got really toned body.
- Does he? Yeah and a face like the elephant man, um That's a shame.
- Did you call Chris up to get - Yeah.
- And he said? - He said "listen to the Stig and work with the lines".
Would you like to see it? Alright.
Who'd like to see Billie's lap? Ok, let's have a look.
Shake and bake.
Second gear.
And third next? Ooop you cut the corner a little bit there but hey that doesn't matter coz it just slows you down.
Where are youwhere're you going? You're on the wrong side of the line.
Must beat Gordon Ramsey.
Ok into the hammerhead and again that's entirely the wrong route.
Oh God, this is terrible.
Jonathan Ross was the last person here to get this lost.
(Fucking) hell.
Yeah, that was you got the right way, didn't turn right there, that's good.
And then through second to last corner, that's where everybody get's it wrong but that's a very good line actually there, and then this isn't and there we are and across the line.
That wasn't great, was it? Well Where do you reckon on the board that was? Please tell me I'm above Steve Coogan.
Above Steve Coogan.
Well you are.
- However we do have a problem.
- Why? You did it in 1 minute 48 point 3.
To the stunned silence of amazement of the entire audience.
But the problem we've got is that we've had to have a word with "His Stigness".
- Why? - Well because you didn't really do a lap of the track.
I mean you didn't do the same lap that all the other people have done.
Does that matter? Well, do you know, yes, it does.
No, it doesn't, please no.
Well, I don't know what to do because the Stig says he reckons it's a 3 second penalty for cutting the corners.
- I told you he was an unpleasant man.
- He's not a nice man.
What do we think? Leave? Leave it there? Leave it there? - People power, I'm sorry - I'm quite happy with that.
Well you would be.
I would do this like "I could get home in a really quick time if I just drove straight through" You're staying where you are.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Billie Piper! - Thank you.
Now, this is the new Mustang We drove it a while back and we found it a bitwell, lame.
But the thing about the Mustang is you can always improve the breed.
As I shall now explain with a rather noisy history lesson One of the many great things about the Mustang Is that it really introduced drivers to the whole idea of options of specking up your car.
So when it first came out in the early 1960s, nobody wanted a bogle standard one with a 6 cylinder engine They wanted ones like this The GT390 This is the Bullit Mustang The one Steve McQueen hurled into movie history around the streets of San Francisco The GT390 is, in car terms One of the seven wonders of the world The noise, the presence Very very few cars live up to their hype.
But this car does, and I should know Because this is my GT390 And I'm using it to make a Mustang point Everything that made it good The engine, the lights, the stripes was extra.
Basically if you wanted a good one You have to forget cheap and cheerful and go for the bells and whistles version And that's what's been missing so far from the new one.
Untill now.
This is the Mustang GT500 And from every angle you can see its muscle car biceps straining to burst out of the body work.
It's also festooned with menacing Cobra badges Attribute to tuning legend Carol Shelby Now Shelby only ever put his name to the fastest and the most powerful Mustangs Which means this thing has gotta be more than just a fashion state.
And it is.
Good, God.
You see this car has the super charged V8 from the Ford GT.
This means power goes up from 300 to 500 horse power.
In America the GT500 has gone down a storm The queues are out of the door and ram the block Now if you wait your turn You could put one of these on your drive in Briton for 35,000 pounds Sounds tempting.
Question is: Should you? Let's start with the power That 500 bhp, it's a bit you know, neat.
This is a rolling road It's a sort of lie detector for engines and gives the true horse power reading Genuenly looking forward to this What it's got? Really? Right So this GT500 actually makes Err.
Almost There you go.
That seems fair enough.
You know, thinking about it, why not got the mechine here.
Please don't hurt it.
It had, when it was brand new, 325bhp And I'm assured by the man who sold me it that this is a fine example of the breed.
Anyway, back to the job in hand and speaking of disappointments Multi-link geometry Dual-way remote reservoir dampers Fully independent rear suspension These are just some of the things that this Mustang hasn't got No, what this car uses is a live axel.
which as rear suspension goes is basically a whacking grate girder with a wheel at each end It's not exactly the most modern layout Noah's Ark had a similar set-up.
Because the technology is old fashioned you can have some good old fashioned fun But when it all goes wrong the Mustang becomes as precise and dynamic as well an ark Now Ford say they didn't give the GT500 modern suspension Because it would've added 5000 dollars to the price of each car.
That is a ridiculous decision You can't just give a car an extra 200 bhp And then leave it with prehistoric suspension What you're left with then is a car that looks great and goes fast in a straight line And that's it.
But don't despair.
If you really want to spend 30 grand on a Mustang that looks good and goes fast in a straight line Then why not buy the one that has the pedigree and the history And makes a great noise Buy this onewell not this one obviously.
It's a bit down on power.
No you're right, you're absolutely right.
You cannot put can't put that much power in a car without changing the suspension - You just can't overbreak.
- Exactly, the rest of it can't handle it.
Anyway, we must now find out how fast the Shelby goes round our track And to do that we gotta put it in the hands of our tame racing driver.
Some say that he isn't machine-washable and all his potted plants are called Steve.
All we know is he's called the Stig Ok away it goes.
And you can see the back wheels bobbing around struggling for grip.
That's the low-tech suspension for you.
Let's see how it affects things in the corners Diving into the first one now.
Looking fairly composed so far, not too bad.
Just breaking loose a little bit on the exit there Radio: Guiding his hands she helped him to unbutton her pretty lilac blouse More gushing fictions from the Stig's collection there.
Chicago now.
You see it tried to cock a back wheel and then it gets all out of shape on the way out.
That is messy Hammerhead now.
Heaving forward on the breaks and he's lurching over into the turns Stig kicks it into a bit of a drift It's smoking inside wheel but not elegant Radio: Locking her arms around his neck she softly pressed her lips to his Into Follow through, chance to see this car in its best now which is in a straight line.
Yep, that's fast through the tires two corners left Oh dear wallowing about like a frisky hippo there Just Gambon to negotiate now He holds it in, dab of opposite lock and across the line He did it in 1:30 exactly - 1:30 so - Precisely, yeah The same as a Monaro Err, yes which is good but It's good, but the thing is you can see it wobbling about in that film I mean the Stig is just all over the place.
And that really brings me on to this Ok? which is the Roush Mustang.
Now it's only got 415 bhp this, OK which obviously isn't as much as the Shelby But they have changed the suspension they have changed the breaks I drove this last year in America and it was just bri I mean really properly brilliant car this.
But if I'm right, this is what? Well yes, but it's 10 grand more car, it really is In fact earlier on, after the Stig'd been out in the Shelby We gave this to him and this is what it looked like out there Here he is, coming up to, where is he now? That's Chicago You see, look, there is no wobbling like there was in the Shelby / amazed.
You hear that supercharger whine and the exhaust This is got a limited slip diff as well which the shelby hasn't so it doesn't just spin all the power away on the inside wheel It's Oh God that's such a nice car.
- Do you know what the time was? - Go on OK 415bhp, what was this? 450 there about.
- It was 1:28 - Wow.
But it is M3 money Yes, but honestly I'd have one of those If I were the sort of person who looked at my sister and thoughtEmm Now earlier, you saw us buy 3 normal cars and turn them into stretch Limousines Then we went down to our test track for a series of challenges And I have to say That Jeremy, your Panda was rubbish, mate.
- Absolutely rubbish - Yeah, it wasn't brilliant, no It came, what? You got the most hits in the anti-terrorist test - Yes it is - And it was knocked out by a hose pipe.
Anyway, for the final challenge We were told to smarten ourselves up Because we will be chauffeuring top celebrities to this year's glittering Brit Awards Yes we would and the winner would be the person who could get the most photographs of their celebrity in the following week's newspapers and magazines This is what happened.
Before being allowed on the road each of our cars had to face a goverment inspection to make sure they were road legal Hammond's sailed through no problem at all and so amazingly did May's me though, I had a problem For some extraordinary reason the rule say you can't drive a 46-foot car on the public high way so I had to do some surgery I had to lot 7 feet out of the middle which has affected the rear leg room a little bit But it is now quite nippy coz it's only emm, 8 feet longer than a bus For my pick up, I had to go to a hotel in Chelsea to collect a Brit Nominee called Lemar He.
.
hello! - Mr.
Lemar - Yes - My name is May.
I'm your chauffeur for the day.
- OK.
Umm, this is your car.
En, it's a it's an Alfa Saab Meanwhile, I've been sent to EMI records in West London It's just got a bit dent, it's very simple to polish it out.
Everyone's a critic.
My VIP pick up was R&B star Jamelia Oh my God.
Hahaha.
OK! No expense spent! While Hammond got the glamorous singer, I had to pick up a fat man Oh, God.
Chris Moyles, Radio 1 This is your luxury limousine transportation Not what I had in mind Right Here we go.
Sit back relax OhWhat's it done? OK, if you'd like to step in That will be great and we'll get off.
What? - Um, this is the intercom.
- Yes.
You press that button if you want to talk to me.
If it starts to rain, don't press it, because you'll get electrocuted.
Eventually though all our passagers were on board and we were ready.
Are you comfortable? No.
Good God.
We were all now heading for Earls Court The Brit's is one of the biggest night in the showbiz calendar with most celebs hoping to look impressive by arriving in a big shiny German car We were gonna show them the error of their ways.
It's better than a Audi this will get you noticed You know what happened to Dave Lee Travis he is on three counties radio now? coz he didn't think to use cars like these for going to awards ceremony Now I've chosen this route to demonstrate the brilliance of my car.
Meanwhile in the Alfaab Lemar was riveted by James' conversation There is a small issue with the congestion charge because as I'm sure you know the camera records the rear view of the car but when they look at the photographs It'll give the regestration number of the saab but the photogragh would show the front of an Alfa So we're looked asso somebody with the wrong sort of car for the number plate has reversed into London back in the Panda my demonstration of its brilliance wasn't going too well You're crutching it.
Oh.
.
Um, it's still standing.
Exactly, there isn't any wrong with it, shush.
We can edit that bit out So when the digital camera takes picture it thinks "Well, that's a Saab" But when they look at the photo they'll see it's a Alfa Romeo And it's going the wrong way Height car on the left there sir.
In the MG poor old Jamelia was attracting a lot of attention from fans Not least because Hammond'd had to modify his intercom to make it legal.
Sorry about the fan thing trying to chat you up there.
That was a bit awkward for you - I'm sure I've got - I can't hear you.
Oh.
.
So, Jamelia was embarrassed in the MG Lemar was bored in the Alfaab and Chris had yet to appreciate the Panda's brilliance.
That, oh.
.
that's That is a catastrophe it's just happened now.
Can you, is that car behind you very close? Yes And then Lemar woke up as he began to realize that James had no idea where he was going The car doesn't have navigation, um? I take it.
Well, it has navigational source, it has a driver who's lived in London for 20 years Where are we now sir? Um, we are just coming onto um.
.
err To distract Chris from the fact that we were almost constantly stuck I engaged him some musical small talk I once went to Earls Court in 1976 saw Bad Company there, Simon Kirke He did a drum solo like you wouldn't believe.
It was now 6 o'clock Lemar was supposed to be at the Brits in half an hour and James was miles away.
stuck in the side streets of central London Actually if you don't mind sir, this is sort of where I need your help - Um, because the reason - OK this car would go round in very small corners is because you can steer it from both ends but I'm afraid I have to ask you to sit in the Alfa Romeo and steer By this stage Moyles was hungry and thirsty and because I haven't thought of include any onboard catering He'd been shopping for supplies.
What was that? I was getting on my seat.
Oh, sorry.
I thought someone's run into us Turn left Right, left? Yeah, your left - My left? - Yeah.
That's it, That's perfect.
You see.
Straight around that very tight bend.
You see now a normal Limousine wouldn't go round like that, would it? Let's do another one, hard left sir OK, so , this umm your steer.
.
The whole thing is not I.
.
you need to straighten it up a little bit - So we're crabbing round badly - I can't Because the whole.
.
you know, your wheel spin is a bit Jamelia was closer to Earls Court than Lemar but no happier The the accelerator's stuck open a bit But if you think about it.
I have to link it to the back of a car It's hydro gas suspension and the clutch and breaks, all the things Oh, hang on.
That doesn't sound good.
That's Oh, sorry.
Road closed.
I'd better go right.
And then it got worse That's not come well, has it? Where are you going? You're going that way, right.
Sorry, sorry.
Ahhh! Sorry.
- Oh my God, you're just the worst driver - Sorry.
That's the famous Harry's department store on the left Earlier when us talking about circles, you know I mean, Harry's, seen it twice.
I don't really need to see it a third time.
The bus couldn't back up and I was stuck on the double mini roundabout - I can't make this turn Chris, at all - Look where you're going.
Thank you.
There we're clear, right.
Earls Court was now just minutes away.
What was that noise? At the Brits The world's media were waiting for Jamelia's arrival I still don't think you appreciate the complexity of linking up a rear engine car when you stretched it.
Please listen just let me get out here! No, no, red carpet there is for you.
I'm so embarrassed! And she wasn't too pleased with my clever exit solution.
No, on the other side, On the other side.
Sorry about the ladder thing coz the steps weren't ideal.
While Jamelia regained her composure I checked on the others.
Jeremy, how are you doing? Umm, not well It's what? Into two pieces on the Lily Road.
It's broken in half.
Haha.
I'm sorry not to give you more support but Sorry Chris.
I'm getting, getting like an hour late, or something like that.
at this rate, isn't it? You know The first time I'm nominated Best male, you know? Hey, best male.
Come on.
Surely sir.
In the music business it's fashionable to be quite late anybody Nobody ever turns up on time really.
There's fashionably late and there's stupidly late, you know.
I can only apologize sir I don't wanna hear anything, just please, just get me there Well, there is five minutes to go May's hopelessly lost Jeremy's car's split in half.
That means, by defaulting nothing else, I'm the winner.
Yeahhh! Hammond may have been gloating.
But I wasn't out of the competition yet.
What time do the awards start? About five minutes.
/ Oh.
Wait, wait, wait - Dignity, wait around a bit - OK, dignity yeah, dignity - Red carpet's over there.
- What? Well So Moyles was happy.
But Hammond wasn't.
You cheated! You finished with half a car.
- You're supposed to finish with a - This is stretch.
I've got the man here Meanwhile, in a car somewhere nowhere near Earls Court Lemar acknowledged as one of the gentleman of pop had had enough.
Strickly speaking is left.
But I think if we go right I can go round the back - What do you mean right? - And then - Well.
.
- Right, why? you just said.
.
Now listen, you just said go left.
- Right, so why.
.
so, so.
.
- Most people would go left.
most peo.
.
so why don't we just follow what most poeple would do? Because I think if we go right No are you doing this intentionally now? - No.
- Thisdecision is just stupid.
It's just stupid.
.
Are you a jerk? - No.
- This is what you planYou come to mess up my day? You picked me up.
You drove me round and round in circles in London.
Been passed Harry's 11 looks hundrud times now.
Left you turn it to go right.
I'm not taking this anymore.
- Open this damn door.
For crying out loud! - I think it's The stupid door doesn't open.
I've had it! Forget it.
Lemar go like that with him after half a day - We have to work with him all the time.
- I know Anyway, clearly, I won.
No hang on a minute.
The competition was to see who could get the most photographs of their celebrity in newspapers and magazines Now I know this is the most pointless question ever Since you ended up in Norridge.
How many? Ahh.
.
None.
- None at all, and you? - None.
Don't tell me there was a picture of Chris Moyles somewhere.
Dataa.
.
look it out.
Read it and weep.
There it is.
Wait, hang on.
That's your page in your newspaper Yes? Well, you cheated.
You two have both got newspaper columns, you could have done it.
You just didn't think.
Come on Jeremy, you can't claim you've won just because of the passport picture.
Yes I can.
It's the winner.
But you hit every single bollard in East London.
- West, James, west.
- Westwhatever And then you finished with half a car.
You're half a person.
It doesn't seem to bother you.
Anyway I .
.
I'm afraid I did win that, chaps "On that bombshell" it's time to end the show and indeed the series.
Um, we've no idea when we'll be back.
I tell you something though.
The three of us will be back here to record a special Top Gear of the Pops for comic relief in a couple of weeks And we hope to see you then Thank you very much for watching, Good night.

<|endoftext|>

Hello, and welcome to Top Gear! Now Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now in the current climate, I think it's very important to reassure you all that everything you see on this show is for real.
Yes, nothing on this show is faked.
In any way.
Which makes it all the more amazing when you see what we've got lined up for you over the next ten weeks.
Hold onto your spleen, everyone! Whoa! No, no, no! Mayday! It's unbelievable! You look like a gay cowboy and you look like a gay terrorist.
Ah! My eyes! Oh, dear! Ooh! He is The Stig's African cousin.
Uh! Ah! That's not gone well.
Come on! I am a road warrior.
Whoo! It's gonna be good.
Right.
- On On with tonight.
- Yes, indeed.
Now, every year the world's Golf GTI enthusiasts congregate in a field in Austria, talk about fuel injection and wear jumpers with GTI on them, and, frankly, I'd rather blowtorch my nipples off.
But Volkswagen every year sends them a little present, a concept car of some kind, to say thank you for your loyalty.
This year, though, disaster.
Volkswagen forgot.
Eight weeks to go.
They had to build something, anything, to keep the fans happy.
Luckily, Volkswagen owns lots of other car companies: Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Skoda, Audi and SEAT.
So they had a big bin to rummage around in for parts.
What they did then, with the clock ticking, was take the rear axle and brakes from a Lamborghini Gallardo, the twin-turbocharged W12 engine from a Bentley Continental and the rear subframe and sort of floor from an Audi R8.
And then they put all these bits and pieces in the body of a Golf.
And here it is.
It's called the GTI W12, and, unlike most concept cars, it actually works.
Sort of.
As you'd expect with a car made so quickly, there are one or two issues.
The paddles here on the steering wheel for the gearbox, they don't work.
These switches here, they don't work.
Satnav does work but thinks it's in Germany.
And these heating and ventilation knobs here, they're not connected to anything.
So I'm very hot.
The 6-liter, 640 horsepower, that works just fine.
As a result, this car will get from 0 to 60 in three and a half seconds.
And it will keep on accelerating all the way to 202.
To contain all the power and the fury, the W12 is six inches wider and three inches lower than a normal Golf.
The roof is made from carbon fiber.
The tires sit like smears of paint on the wheels, and the engine is where you'd expect to find the back seats.
To cool it there are massive intake vents in the sills.
That's why the bottom of the car is swollen like your granny's ankles.
And they made all these changes in just eight weeks.
However did they lose? The funny thing is that you sit here looking at a Golf dashboard and a Golf bonnet through a Golf windscreen, and you think, "Well, it's a Golf.
" But it so isn't! It's not a particularly savage car.
It doesn't explode when you stamp on the accelerator.
It's just this surge of power that takes you up to five and a half thousand rpm and then the surge becomes a flood! I can't get away from it! It is an insane car, this.
to find it has 640 horsepower is like opening up Gordon Brown's trousers and finding he's wearing stockings and suspenders, mad.
Unfortunately, there is a small problem.
This car will not go round corners.
The wheel base is short and it's rear-wheel drive so you have to be extremely gentle.
You have to treat all the controls like they're made of glass.
Even if you're really gentle, you'll still Yes.
Yes.
You'll still end up coming out of the corner backwards like that.
I meant that.
Tame the understeer.
There's a lot of it.
I've got it.
No, I haven't.
An hour later, I reckoned I was getting somewhere.
Calm! Calm! Calm! Calm! Yes.
Sh .
That doesn't work either.
I think the kindest thing I can say about about the brakes and the suspension is they're, um they're not finished yet.
Yes, classic stuff.
Smoke everywhere! - You were.
- I wasn't.
Let me get one thing absolutely clear.
This isn't actually gonna go on sale, is it? No, Volkswagen sent it to us cos they said, "If people like it then we put it into production.
" They're not gonna get any encouragement from me, to be honest.
That is ghastly.
My biggest problem with it is, that I can't see the point of saying, "I've got a supercar and it looks like a Golf!" That's like "I'm married to a supermodel and she looks like a traffic warden!" It doesn't make any sense.
Even so, we must now see how quickly it can crash on our track.
And for that we need our tame racing driver.
Yes.
Some say that his scrotum has its own small gravity field.
And that because our producer rigged a phone vote, he now has a new name.
All we know is he's called Cuddles.
And he's off.
Now, we know this car is frisky but if anyone can tame it, this is the man.
First corner.
Twitchy on the braking.
Tires howling in pain.
Back on the power.
That is nicely done.
No CD today because, predictably, the stereo doesn't work.
Nursing it round there carefully.
Another huge surge of power coming up to Hammerhead.
Wriggling its hips under the brakes.
He's chucked it in.
It's biting backl every inch of the way.
Listen to that.
In a Bentley that engine is as quiet as a startled deer.
Here it's like being chased by an imploding star, and about as scary.
Winding it up, here he comes now through the tires.
Just two accidents waiting to happen now.
Turns in.
Look at the oversteer.
Cuddles is really having to wrestle it through there.
Up to Gambon.
He's taking it very gingerly, and I'm not surprised.
And here we are, and across the line.
Yeah.
Got the time here.
The time is So, Top Gear top tip.
If you want a slow car that looks like a Golf, get a Golf.
Right, it's time for a question, and the question is "Where is the best driving road in the world?" Something that has everything, the challenging bends, no traffic, the great views, the long fast straights, the lot.
Yep.
Now, it's unlikely to be here, because everyone just flies.
It's not gonna be here because everyone's on drugs.
That's all just full of ox.
Al Gore says that's gone, so it's not gonna be down there.
That's full of spiders.
- Signposts are gibberish.
They're communists.
- Jeremy! Can't go there, the Americans'll shoot you.
- No! Thank you! - What? All right.
Obviously we did discuss this at length.
We eventually decided that the best driving road in the world was probably somewhere in continental Europe, specifically around here, the Alps.
Then we decided that the best thing for us to do was to go there and see if we could find it.
This is where our quest began in the mountains above Monte Carlo in the South of France.
Obviously, you can't go looking for the best driving road in the world in a Japanese hatchback or a people carrier.
So what we thought we'd do is bring along a selection of the new generation of lightened supercars.
I've chosen this, the new Porsche 911 GT3 RS.
In essence, the GT3 is a lighter, tauter version of the normal 911.
And this, the RS, is a lighter, tauter version of the GT3.
So this is, in fact, the ultimate version of the ultimate version of the ultimate version of the world's ultimate supercar.
No, it isn't.
The ultimate F-plan supercar is what I've brought along.
It's a Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera, and it's like a normal Gallardo but it's 100 kilograms lighter and the V10 engine is a bit more powerful.
That is quite a recipe.
Yeah, it is if you're a fat, middle-aged bloke who wants to bore everybody about the track days you've been on.
As you'd expect, I've done it properly and got myself a proper gentleman's racer, the Aston Martin V8 Vantage N24.
James, that is just a racing car.
It hasn't got anything in it, even a passenger seat.
This isn't just some road car with a bit of scaffolding in the back.
It's 250 kilograms lighter than the standard car.
That's the weight of a big motorcycle.
- So you've got no radio.
- No.
- You've got no carpets.
- No air conditioning.
You have got a car with no air conditioning in the South of France in the middle of summer.
It's better than that.
His windows don't open.
- Yes, they do, actually.
- That's a cat flap.
You've done the same thing.
You have got standard road cars dressed with the tinsel of fake high performance.
- Has it got air conditioning? - Yes.
- Have you? - Oh, yeah.
- Shall we go? - Yes, shall we go? It's getting a bit muggy.
Right.
Master switch on.
Hoo-hoo-hoo! Er ignition switch on.
- Er - Faffing around.
Fuel reset.
Pumps are reset.
Fan is off.
Neutral.
Engine start.
Yes.
Excellent.
Strapping in.
Er that one must go in there.
Er Oh, God.
I've done three minutes and I already adore this car.
So much fun! Eventually James caught us up so we turned off the motorway and began our search for driving heaven.
It didn't take long.
We found something called the Col de Turini, a ribbon of tarmac that doesn't really go anywhere, so it was quiet.
Till we arrived.
This looked like the ideal place to unleash our cars a little bit.
Lamborghini have used their nous with this car.
They haven't just lobbed away all the things that you might need.
It's got a thinner prop shaft, more delicate drive shafts.
The engine cover's made of plastic rather than glass.
Even the wheel nuts are made from titanium.
All of those little things add up to 100 kilograms.
They were gonna ditch the four-wheel drive system to save another 50 kilograms but today, here now, on this road I'm glad they didn't.
I was loving the Lamborghini but, if anything, Richard was loving his Beetle even more.
There is something fantastically purposeful about this car.
They haven't been flash and messed about with trying to make it look pretty.
They've just taken off what they can take off, made lighter what they can make lighter, and away you go.
This thing revs higher than the standard car so you can just keep on going.
They're so smug about their fancy-boy versions of lightweight cars.
When you drive a really, really stripped out car like this, you're put back in touch with what driving is about.
You can hear all the machinery working, and you can feel what it does.
And I was glad I didn't have air conditioning.
I don't know if you've ever picked up an air conditioning pipe, but it is very, very heavy.
And it saps some of the power of the engine.
I suppose it would be a good idea at this juncture to explain why a lightweight car is a good idea.
You see, the problem is modern cars are very heavy.
They've got all sorts of safety equipment on and airbags.
We demand luxuries like satellite navigation.
And all this weight, it spoils the acceleration, it ruins the fuel consumption, upsets the handling.
And getting rid of it makes everything better.
Oh, wow.
Look at this.
Now, look at this bit.
This road is used as a special stage on the Monte Carlo Rally.
It's busy, it's twisty, it's got low walls that you can go over, huge drops that can kill you with ease.
Meanwhile in the Aston I didn't care about James, though.
I just cared about this amazing road.
There's something about stringing together a load of hairpins.
What a road.
I mean, what a road.
Honestly, it's Ha-ha! Metallic rattle.
I keep belting my elbow on something really, really hard.
Oh, shut up.
Richard and I were now so far ahead of Captain Slow, we decided to pull over.
How's your Beetle? Fine, thank you.
How's your Audi? Very funny.
Very funny in there.
Yeah.
The harder I drove to catch up, the more unbearable the noise became.
- Your Porsche, OK - Yeah.
is L15,000 more - Than a GT3.
than a normal GT3.
- Cos it's got fewer parts.
- It's lighter.
So the fewer parts you have on your Porsche, the more expensive it becomes.
Until you get to the point where somebody with no Porsche gets charged a million pounds.
Oh, no.
Look, hang on.
On price, how much is yours? - How much more is it than an ordinary one? - That's a pretty flower.
No, how much more is it? Come on, how much more is it than an ordinary one? - 26,000.
- Twenty-six grand.
There you go.
For what? Here he comes.
Finally.
Ooh, my testicles.
- That is unbelievably good.
- Oh, yeah? What do we think about that road? You don't want to talk about your car, then, James? No, we're here to find a good road.
- You don't like your car.
- The car's excellent.
- You know you've made a mistake.
- No, it's fantastic.
Well, I think that road's a benchmark.
It's a good starting point.
- Now we should go and find a better one.
- OK.
- Italy.
- What? No, Switzerland.
- What about Austria? - He just wants to talk about the war.
You'll get all maudlin and unbearable.
- No, I think Austria is - Not smooth roads? - It's the smooth roads.
- It is the smooth roads.
It's because his suspension's so hard.
Italy's got really bumpy roads.
Italy would be quite entertaining.
We should probably look at Italy.
A little beep there.
Telling me I've used a tank of fuel already.
That's not good.
I've got to get the seat higher up.
This is ridiculous.
I've got I'm like an 85-year-old man.
I was out of juice.
Pardon.
And although the camera crew had more, I couldn't get it from their cans into the car.
Whoa! Do you know what's happened here? Audi, who own Lamborghini, they've built all of the car and then, just let the Italians, to keep them happy, do one thing.
- Hi! - Oh, dear.
Nice view here.
- Just thought you'd stop and admire it? - Yeah, I might need your help.
- Why? - There might be a problem.
- What? - Fuel filler cap won't open.
Never mind.
See you in Italy.
No I broke out the instruction manual, which was all in Italian.
Console centrale con intellitori, apurturri, sportello refornimento.
"We are useless Italians and we haven't built this properly.
" Ah! Yes! the motorway along the Italian Riviera.
By no means was this a great driving road but there were some consolations.
It's a symphony is what it is.
The big V10 in this.
The flat 6 of Hammond's Porsche.
Then that brutal V8 in the racing car.
The trouble with tunnel blasting in a car with atomic power like the Lambo is that the fuel economy does drop a bit.
I was doing nine miles to the gallon.
Oh, dear.
- Is this your second fill-up? - Yes.
See, mine's got a 110-liter endurance fuel tank.
If you need to get in my slipstream cos you don't have much power At no point have I lacked in power to keep up with this thing.
How many horsepower? - 415.
- 522.
It's how it uses them.
It's how it deploys them.
- Top speed? - 175.
- Top speed? - 185ish.
This is probably quite a good car, but it's half-hearted and limp-wristed.
It's not a real luxury supercar - This should be good.
or a proper lightweight.
James, a little compromise might be useful in your car.
Be honest.
No.
I love it.
In fact he loved it so much, he bought it a present.
- What's that? - I've bought a cushion.
- Are you admitting that it's uncomfortable? - Yeah.
No, no, no.
- Hammond.
- Hold on.
- He's admitting his car is uncomfortable.
- No.
That's interior design.
It's a scatter cushion to look pretty.
So much nicer.
My poor buttocks.
Yeah, but would the weight of that cushion be a problem if Hammond and I suddenly decided that we were eight years old? Paddle on the right! The Lambo and the Porsche are very, very close.
The Aston Martin seems to be very, very slow.
Didn't expect that in the racing car.
We were heading for the Italian lakes but it was time to stop for the night.
And since I'd insisted on coming to Italy, I'd booked the hotel.
This doesn't look like a very good town.
They're going to shout at me.
Tell me we've stopped here - Well, it could be worse.
to steal some wheels or something.
How could it be how could this be worse? That's the motorway! Jeremy, I always wanted to stay in the Italian lakes.
- Are we staying here tonight? - Well, yes.
So we're carrying on by bicycle tomorrow? These will have been stolen.
They did stay that they'd got a secure car park that nobody could break into.
And I can see what they mean.
There's absolutely no way that anybody could possibly get into this car park in any way, shape or form.
- It's actually very simple.
- What were you thinking? D'you know my car doesn't have a key or a lock? Do they save weight by not fitting locks? I'm really sorry.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
That hotel had no bar, no restaurant, no air conditioning in the rooms.
No, it was like being in his car.
Which is why we left the crew behind and us three all went nearer to the lakes, found another hotel.
- And the lakes are to the north.
- Yes.
- And which way did you take us? - North east.
You made us drive 200 kilometers in the wrong direction.
I did that.
I did do that.
But we found a hotel in the end and all was well.
- You ruined our holiday.
- I did, and I'm very sorry about that.
But we must now move on because it's time to meet our guest.
Now, the star in the reasonably priced car tonight once said that she and her husband set their alarm clock an hour early every morning so they had a chance to make love before going to work, much like James May, although, of course, he lives alone.
Ladies and gentlemen, star of everything that matters, Dame Helen Mirren! You're looking so lovely.
Oh! I can rest now.
Have a seat.
I'll have a seat.
Oh.
I can't tell you how excited I am - Oh, yes, you can.
to have you here.
No, I really, genuinely mean it.
I know everybody talks to you about The Queen.
- Prime Suspect as well.
- Mm-hm.
- But you were in The Long Good Friday.
- Yeah, I was.
Now, this to me is just the greatest film of all time.
Three quarters of them have never heard of The Long Good Friday.
- They're far too young.
- Have you heard of it? Yes.
- This audience, you see - Yeah.
Well-educated.
- Yeah.
- They have heard of it.
Do you live in LA? I've been trying to clear this up.
- No, I live in Wapping.
- You live in Wapping.
- But you've got a house in LA.
- My husband's American.
So we spend a lot of time there - Is it normal over there? in that car culture, you know.
- Um is it what? - Normal in Los Angeles.
No, it's weird.
You'd love it because people live in their cars and they do everything in their cars.
Um Now, your autobiography.
I've actually read it, unlike - No, really? - I have.
I got to one chapter where I went a bit white, where you were living in Parsons Green.
- This is in Fulham in southwest London.
- Yes, I used to hear it going over.
You What was it? You became disillusioned with British society.
Because of all the young Hoorays living round there throwing bread rolls.
- Yes.
- That was me.
I did live in Parsons Green.
- You didn't! - I did.
- And did you throw food? - Yes.
I used to order it for its aerodynamic efficiency.
You were one of those ghastly, ghastly guys! Oh, my God! That drove me out of England.
Now, didn't you also say somewhere this the other day, that I was reading, that I remind you of Paris Hilton? Yes, I said you were like Paris Hilton.
Yes, I did.
I look in the mirror every morning and go, "I'm Paris? Oh, no, I'm not.
" No, but the thing is, Jeremy, you are uber-male, you know, and Paris is uber-female, and I think that you're both you're the two sides of the same coin, actually.
Well, I don't put pictures of myself naked on the internet.
That's one thing I don't do.
- Maybe I'll give it a whirl.
- Actually, neither did she, to her credit.
Someone else did it.
Here's a tip, Paris, if you're watching.
Have sex without a camera.
Now, let's move on to motoring if we may.
I don't think we're gonna agree on much here.
Cos you're not really a big car fan.
No, my first car was a disaster.
- MG Midget.
Those little white things.
- Yeah.
My brother my brother sold it to me.
The engine blew up within two days.
- But didn't you have a Golf GTI? - Yes, I did, I did.
That came to a sticky end, my poor old Golf GTI.
Why? What happened to it? Well, I was doing theater in, um at the Old no, the Young Vic, excuse me, in Waterloo, and I'd just cleared out my closet and I had all this stuff to take to the charity shop.
And then I thought, "Well, you know" There were no charity shops.
I didn't have the time.
And I knew that everyone said, "Keep your car locked around here," because things get nicked out of the car.
So I thought, "Perfect, I'll leave my stuff in the car, "I'll leave the car open, and it'll all get nicked.
" But instead of the stuff getting nicked, my car got torched.
- No! - Yeah.
I came out, it was like this hulk.
- So what have you got now? - I don't have a car now, actually.
- Haven't you got an Oyster card? - Yes, I do.
Yeah.
- What is one? - It's a brilliant thing.
It's this little thing, and when you go on public transport, which are like buses and tubes and trains, you have this little card and you swipe it and you're on.
- Why wouldn't you go in a car, though? - You sit on the bus, and there's a chauffeur.
In a uniform.
- A tramp sitting next to you, vomiting on you.
- And there are nice people No.
Can we talk about supercars briefly? - What's a supercar? - Ferraris, Lamborghinis.
Where are you on on those? - What do you think of a - Well a middle-aged chap in a Lambo? Well, I think Well, I just think most guys who drive those I always thought, "" you know.
I mean Oh.
Sorry.
I was gonna say That's sad cos Richard Hammond's got one.
- Oh, he hasn't, has he? Oh, no.
- He has.
He's not a pillock.
He's he's a nice guy.
So I'm sorry, Richard.
- Is he? - Yeah.
I thought he was a pillock.
So, OK.
The lap, obviously.
Was it fun? It Well, I don't know if fun is the right word.
It was terrifying.
It was nerve-racking.
It was adrenaline-pumping.
My hands were shaking like this at the end.
It was sweat-making.
It was it was fabulous.
- You did like it? - It was fabulous.
Oh, that's all right.
- Shall we have a look at it? - Yes! Right.
Sorry about the television but here we go.
It's like being in the '60s.
That's an aggressive start.
Later, harder, longer.
Later, harder Are you doing the shipping forecast in there? Douglas, Dogger - Hard.
- Slow.
Later.
Harder.
- Faroe.
Is that what The Stig told you to do? - He did.
- Did he tell you to do that? - Slower.
Harder.
Slow into the corners and then fast out.
- So it's slow.
Now go.
Go! - Go, go! You idiot! My language is bluer than that.
Here we go.
It's such a silly-looking little car.
- Did you like it? - No.
No, it's awful, isn't it? Ooh, yes.
I liked that bit best.
Cutting the corner there.
Now we're really picking up speed.
That's the wrong gear.
Is that fourth? Can you tell? It was third.
It was going She's picking up speed.
This is Michael Gambon's corner, where we nearly lost him.
And round there.
And there we are, ladies and gentlemen, across the line.
Whoo-hoo! So.
Miraculously undamaged in the fire is our board.
- You had a fire? - Channel 5 set fire to everything we own.
- No! - Honestly, they did.
That's why we're in rubbish furniture.
I apologize.
But this survived.
And where do you think you've come now? - If this is the thespian zone - Yes, well, am I in the thespian zone? Yes.
Ray Winstone.
Kristin Scott Thomas.
Yes.
Rick Wakeman is not a thesp.
Well, he is, actually.
- Brian Cox.
And Jimmy Carr, a comedian.
- I have no idea.
- Ready? One - Yes.
fifty - Oh.
No.
What do you mean, "Oh"? two point eight.
- Not bad.
- Which puts you right Thank you.
- Not very high up.
- So how many Oscars have you won? One.
- Emmies? - Four.
- Golden Globes? - Three, I think.
Three.
And now it turns out you're faster round our track than Rick Wakeman.
- Ladies and gentlemen, Dame Helen Mirren.
- What a triumph! Thank you.
So, let's get back to tonight's big film in which the three of us are attempting to find the best driving road in the world in these three lightweight supercars.
Yes, now, we can't agree which one is the best, only that his Aston is just awful.
We couldn't agree on where we wanted to go.
I wanted to go to Austria.
He wanted to go to Switzerland.
But when we left the action, we were driving hundreds and hundreds of boring motorway miles because Jeremy said that the Italian lakes would be brilliant.
Look at it.
Lake Maggiore is just fantastic.
And as for the roads Us out for a day on a motorway in an oven, essentially, for this.
This road is rubbish.
The traffic, coupled with the hotel fiasco the night before, had put the chaps in quite a bad mood.
We come all the way here in these cars and you it up because you're a ing feeble-minded .
- Are you I think - Utter, utter .
ing useless.
Look at the color of that water.
That's beautiful.
Why did you think this would be good, you big daft ? Trust me, Italy is the place.
- It's the home of the fast car.
It's - Shut up! I mean, why did we bother? We should have just come here on a bus.
There is a speed bump on the road.
Oh, that's the final straw.
Whoa! I'm exploring the limits of grip here.
Essentially, he's brought us up somebody's driveway.
Realizing that I'd mucked things up a bit I suggested we try the other side of the lake, which meant catching a ferry.
What are we experiencing next? The world's greatest driving forest.
- Well, where do you want to go? - Switzerland! - Switzerland is rubbish.
- Laws, laws, laws.
Do you want to wash your car when you get to Switzerland? Because you can't by law.
- If they're - Want to lower your suspension? - Not allowed.
- No.
A tiny bit of speeding.
Prison.
Trust me, Switzerland is the wrong country.
I'm not going to Austria.
Eventually we arrived at the other side.
So they can get the air conditioning on.
- Seventeen degrees? - I can have it about that, yes.
Yeah, I think I'm gonna have 17.
It's half twelve now.
It's really getting hot.
Oh, no.
Oh.
In order for the ferry to unload, James had to disembark first.
Hang on a minute.
Something's not quite right.
- What's the matter? - It's broken.
- Has it got fuel in it? - Yeah, it's got loads of fuel.
Despite the horns, James wouldn't rush his pre-flight checks.
Master switch.
Ignition.
Pump.
Pump.
That's off.
Very fast.
At least it's light.
Jeremy, we're keeping everybody on the boat now.
That lady's shouting.
- Sorry.
- Scusi.
I can't get through there.
Back up.
Your country makes supercars.
You can't honk when somebody goes out and buys one.
That is the correct position because that's on and the panel is on.
The ignition is down.
Everything else is off.
Do you want get the Let's get this.
Ah-ha-ha! Ah! Ah! - Ha-ha! Bugger! - That's the hottest thing in the world! The fuel With the idiot's car now working, we found the road on the other side of the lake was a boring dual carriageway.
Still, there was one good thing.
We were heading north to where I'd wanted to go in the first place.
Switzerland.
Oh, please let's find something good.
We did.
This is the San Bernardino Pass.
Wow.
I think a bootful would be appropriate.
Yeah.
The Swiss will look on these three cars as though the Antichrist has come to their little world.
But I didn't care.
The hills are alive to the sound of horsepower.
Meanwhile in the Aston The San Bernardino Pass was something else.
The views, the smoothness of the road surface, the elegance of the road itself.
But Richard wasn't finished and insisted we kept heading north.
I wonder where he's taking us.
Wow.
Lichtenstein.
The only thing I know about Lichtenstein is, they make more false teeth here than anywhere else in the world.
Probably why Hammond has brought us here.
I do hope it contains a brilliant road, and I've a good feeling about this place.
And so outside the, um museum, I pulled over to consult our map.
You see, we want bends.
That stretch looks Lichtenstein was the last country in Europe to give women the vote.
It was in 1984.
That is in Lichtenstein.
If the population of Lichtenstein went to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, there'd be 39,500 empty seats.
Yeah, but back to the road.
If we carry on up here, this bit wiggles.
Look at those turns.
Do you know this is a tax haven? It's got more companies here than people.
That is a killer stretch of road.
That's a beauty.
- Shall we try each other's cars for this bit? - What? - Why don't we try each other's cars? - No, I like this one, mate.
- Do you want to go in this? - No.
Right, so this, theoretically, is the start of the greatest driving road in the world.
I fear I may have made a slight mistake here.
He had.
There was a cycle race on and his brilliant road was closed.
- What? - Are we allowed to drive on it? - No.
- No.
- It's shut! - It is a bit.
You've dragged me all the way to Lichtenstein to go on a road that's shut! A bit.
Completely.
- Where do you want to go now? - Austria.
You go to Austria.
We can't smell your pits from there.
I'm going back to Italy.
Reluctantly the others agreed to come with me.
So we headed back through Switzerland stopping off for the night in the ski resort of Davos.
It had been a bad day.
We'd been through three countries and only found one good bit of road.
So Richard and I decided to vandalize James's Aston.
Half of me wants him to just drive all day with it on.
He'll never notice.
You know what James is like.
He doesn't notice anything.
He's not coming, is he? K.
That's Kevin.
Sounds like a racing driver's name.
And he's bought us a drink.
You're all right, you're all right.
The next morning, we headed south out of Davos and couldn't quite believe what we'd stumbled on.
Mile after mile of deserted perfection.
Even Jeremy had to concede I was right about Switzerland.
This is absolute heaven.
Oh-ho-ho! Oh, this is much more like it.
What was God thinking of when He gave the Swiss this place? Plainly, it should be ours.
This road was a test of brakes, steering, grip, power and handling.
An ideal place, then, to reflect on the cars we'd brought on our motoring holiday.
Everything about this car now has come alive.
It's suddenly in its element.
God, this thing just tracks so perfectly.
Meanwhile in the Aston I wonder how much more I have to endure before I can admit that this is a terrible car and that I hate it and I want to go home.
There's actually a physically pleasurable sensation that runs up your arm when you turn the wheel.
It It's uncanny.
"Jeremy Clarkson today married a Lamborghini and moved to Switzerland.
" And then it hit me.
I was in a Lamborghini in the Alps.
All I need is a pair of sunglasses and some Matt Munro.
We'd all pretty much decided that we'd found driving heaven.
Well, two of us had.
But then after we popped over the border and back into Italy we found a cherry for the top of our cake.
The Stelvio Pass.
Fifteen miles of asphalt spaghetti draped on an Alp.
It was stunning.
Shall we do it? Here we go.
The drops! It's impossible! You go over the edge here, you'd have time to phone the insurers.
There's no other way of saying it.
This is a magnificent piece of road-building.
It's not like PlayStation, this.
You can't just press the reset button when you get it wrong.
You just go through the pearly gates on fire.
I hate to admit this, but this Aston is starting to make a certain amount of good sense.
Even the brakes have stopped squeaking.
Climbing up now past 8,000 feet.
I think at this altitude the Lambo has got the advantage.
I shall solve that, though, with some bravery.
This is hard work.
If I had no air conditioning, I'd look ridiculous now.
What an extraordinary road! Thank you, Italy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
We finished our run, and as the cars ticked themselves cool, we knew their work was done.
Davos to Stelvio, the greatest driving road in the world.
Yeah.
Well, lads, that was a good holiday.
- Yeah.
- A great holiday.
There you are.
If you're thinking of going on holiday next year, forget Center Parcs.
Just go there.
Yes, now, the cars.
- So, James.
- No.
- That's no on every level.
Richard? - The Porsche was fantastic.
I loved it.
But the main problem about that car is, I don't see why it's 15 grand more for the RS version than the ordinary GT3.
Same on the Lambo.
I can't believe that I wouldn't have as much fun in a normal Gallardo.
And if you're gonna do a special edition Lamborghini, put stuff on like space thrusters and machine guns cos that's what Lamborghinis are all about.
So hang on, we took three cars on holiday and they were all wrong.
- Mm.
- Yes, we're back in business.
Yeah.
Top Gear, ambitious but rubbish.
- That's us.
- There'll be more of that next week.
Good night!

<|endoftext|>

Tonight, James May faces trial by water.
Richard Hammond faces trial by fire.
Hello! Hello and good evening.
Thanks very much.
Now, ever since Honda dropped the NSX a couple of years ago, the Porsche 911 was the only supercar, - if you can call it a supercar - Which you can.
Was the only supercar that you could use every day.
- And it still is.
- Well, you see, no, it isn't.
- Because now there's a new kid on the block.
- No, there isn't.
Audis are mainly built for German cement salesmen.
Not this one, though.
This is the R8.
It's made from a blend of carbon fiber, magnesium and aluminum.
It has two seats.
The engine's in the middle, and it's about as high off the ground as a badger's badger.
By any measure it's a full-on supercar but so far as I can tell it doesn't have any of the usual supercar drawbacks.
You can see out of it, for a kickoff.
And it's not powered by some V17 quad turbo that does half a mile to the gallon and runs on diced lions.
It's actually got the same 4.
2 liter V8 that Audi put in the RS4 Saloon.
And would you listen to it? I am now doing 100 mph and it sounds like I'm in church.
Only I've got more headroom.
And how have they done that? How can there be so much space in a car that's so low? How? I can only presume, and this is a revolting thought, I know, that my buttocks are actually kissing the cat's-eyes.
Not only is it spacious but it's comfortable as well.
And at L77,000 it costs about half as much as its stepsister, the Lamborghini Gallardo.
It all sounds brilliant.
But there are one or two issues that are worth mentioning.
Most of the things on it, the leather upholstery, the satellite navigation, the stainless-steel pedals, the Bang & Olufsen stereo, in fact nearly everything is an optional extra.
And I don't think it's a particularly good-looking car.
It's not balanced properly somehow.
And those LED fairy lamps at the front, they really don't work at all.
They make it look like a council house at Christmas.
The thing is, though, you won't care about the headlamps when you open the taps a little bit.
Naught to 60 takes 4.
6 seconds.
The top speed is as near as makes no difference, 190.
It's not the speed, though, that impresses you most of all.
It's the way this thing feels through the corners.
Driving most supercars is like trying to manhandle a cow up a back staircase.
This is like smearing honey into Keira Knightley.
It may have four-wheel drive but it never sends more than a third of the power to the front wheels.
So you don't really ever get any understeer.
It's grip, grip, grip, and then if it does let go, it's just so manageable.
I'm, um I'm completely sold.
As far as I'm concerned, this car is almost without fault.
- It is absolutely stunning.
- Rubbish.
I'll show you stunning.
This is the best 911, the Carrera 2S.
It costs about the same as the Audi, and will now run four rings round it.
Ah, Richard Hammond appears to have joined us in his Volkswagen Beetle.
So you want to play? Right.
Sport suspension on.
Traction control off.
Here goes.
The thing is, with that Audi you're just not as involved in the drive.
It's like he's back at base pushing plastic pieces around on a war planning table.
And this? I'm on the front line getting stuck in.
He's probably rabbiting on in there about how he feels an organic part of the machine but the simple fact of the matter is he's behind me.
Obviously, through the corners, I have the four-wheel drive grip and then on the straights his miserable Flat 6 is no match for this V8 tower of power.
Hold on.
I think his engine's broken.
I can't hear it.
It's almost silent.
What's the point of having a supercar that doesn't shout about it all? My driving letting us down there.
Mind you, Hammond's driving also letting him down.
Fearing that this would end up in a crash and a fireball, we pulled over for an argument.
No, come on.
No.
It's not just about the result.
It's about the sensation along the way.
The problem with this, mate, is they put the engine in the back, OK? - Wrong place.
- No.
Look, horse and cart.
I know, let's put the horse at the back! So in your case they put the horse in the middle, in the cart.
Yes, but it's balanced.
No, that is one of the defining characteristics of that car.
- What? - It defines the shape, which is aerodynamic.
The packaging means with the engine behind the rear wheels, you've got room for another set of seats so you can use it.
Why do you want seats in the back? I took the kids to school in that this morning and drove straight here.
Well, I didn't.
So who's the daddy now? I said, "Kids, go with your mother because I've got no seats.
" - Why has it got silly gray bits, Dad? - They are side blades.
Having resolved nothing, we decided to settle it intelligently with a half-mile drag race.
Well, I've got about 70 brake horsepower less, but it's lighter.
His four-wheel drive will bog down off the line.
I really want to win this cos I really, really like this car.
I mean, a lot.
I've got the engine on the rear wheel so I've got the advantage in traction.
I'm confident ish.
I am ahead, clearly! He's definitely got better traction off the line.
- I can't see him.
Where is he? - Hundred and twenty.
Here we go.
Oh, no! Oh, no! Come on, come on, come on! - Who won? - I've no idea.
Honestly.
Aha! Now Now what's going on? - I didn't see.
- Neither did I but we're gonna find out.
Can we see a slow-motion replay of that finish, please? Here we go.
Oh, yes! Clearly! Yeah! No, no! No! No, you lost.
That is an L for Loser.
Ah, but very soon there's gonna be a V10 version of this.
Not the Lambo V10.
Audi's own.
Then ha-ha! - Yeah, I wouldn't hold your breath.
- Why? Did you hear what happened to the prototype? We have a photograph of it here, if we look up.
- That's on fire.
It's clearly on fire.
- It's just steam.
- Really? - Yes.
Would you like to see what happened once they put the "steam" out? - Yeah.
- There's the car.
That's ooh, that's steamed.
- It's steamed.
- Yes, well steamed.
Can we just get on? No.
I tell you what.
I'm gonna settle this once and for all.
I'm gonna put it to the audience.
I'm gonna hold a general election right here, right now.
This is a very popular car.
You know there's a L30,000 premium on these at the moment.
You go ahead if you want.
Actually, no, I've suddenly decided that a general election right now is a stupid idea.
Because I might lose.
Why don't you just stay where you are and nick all my ideas? That's a good idea.
In fact it was my idea to do just that.
- It's a great car.
- It's a brilliant car.
I've said that from the start.
But we must now find out how fast this goes round our track and that means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
Some say that he's banned from the town of Chichester.
And that in a recent late-night deal he bought a slightly dented white Fiat Uno from the Duke of Edinburgh.
All we know is he's called The Stig.
He's off.
Track looking a bit damp.
Hope that won't hurt the time as he powers down to the first corner, lights twinkling like the Woolworths sale there.
But very smooth, very flat.
Remember that you are always in control.
No feelings of tension, irritability.
Stig seems to have got himself some self-help CDs as he flicks it beautifully through Chicago.
Chassis really is sublime.
Let's see how he copes with the Hammerhead.
Slow in then back on the power.
No real drama there at all.
In these conditions it's just excellent.
Be aware only of yourself and have no concern for the thoughts or expectations of your partner.
Straight through the Follow-Through.
No problem.
They have the same engine as the magnificent RS4.
This is so much more nimble.
Dances through the tire wall.
0K, two corners left.
Staying level and focused.
There isn't a single moment's drama in it.
A bit of mud on the apexl And there he is across the line.
Now mm-hm.
Now, earlier today Earlier today, the Stig, he took the Porsche round, OK? So we could get a time for that.
We've got some footage of him coming up to the second-to-last corner here.
Yeah, there he is.
What do you make of this, Richard? Very good.
Very strong stuff, as I'd expect.
Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! No! Ah! It's my idea to say, as I've always said, that the engine's in the wrong place in a Porsche, and that was - Was never my idea that you've stolen.
- No, no, it's my idea.
But he went round again and he did it in 1 minute 26.
2 seconds, OK? Then he went out in the Audi.
- 1 minute 24.
4 seconds.
- Oh.
I predicted that from the start, obviously.
- Will you now admit that that is a better car? - Yes, I do.
Yes! It is brilliant.
I I Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
A couple of years ago, the three of us were asked to make amphibious cars and, if we're honest, it didn't go all that well.
James's Herald was pretty good on the water but then there were some problems on land.
Oh, cock.
Richard's damper van was rubbish on the land - and then even more rubbish in the water.
- It's going! My toy boater, on the other hand, was brilliant everywhere, right up to the moment when it, um rolled over.
Now that is pretty much par for the course on Top Gear.
We're always setting ourselves ambitious targets asking, "How hard can it be to make a convertible people carrier "or turn a Fiat Panda into a stretch limo?" And everything always ends up either broken in half or on fire or sunk.
And then we give up and move on.
But with amphibious cars the producer said no, we had to try again.
Mm, they said no more fooling about, we had to concentrate, we were told to refine our original ideas and then meet in a car park near Sidcup, - which is just outside London on the M24.
- Five.
- M5.
- 25.
Right.
Jeremy was the first to arrive.
There we are.
Now, obviously, my, um original plan of simply bolting a very large outboard engine to the back of a pick-up truck worked very well, until it rolled over.
So to prevent that happening again, what I've done is I've welded up the doors much more thoroughly this time.
That should stop water getting into the cockpit and sloshing from side to side.
In the back I've fitted these big drums which, when I go in the water, I simply lower them like this, so they're like sort of stabilizers on a child's bicycle, and that should give me more, um um um - Stability.
- Yes, that.
Next Hammond arrived.
- No.
- Yeah.
- No, you see, Hammond - Yes? what you've done there, mate, is you've parked a van on top of a boat.
No, it's brilliant.
Let me tell you.
It is a refinement of the theory.
- Flying bridge.
Completely equipped.
- It's not a flying bridge.
More or less.
And this is where the girls go, up here - No, Richard.
in bikinis.
- I see.
Would you like to step down? - Yes.
- Stand at the wheel.
- Yes.
- Look ahead.
- Yeah, that is an issue.
I need a box.
I need a sailing box.
As before, Richard had stuck with the cabin cruiser principle.
And as before, to make it move in the water, he'd simply fixed a propeller to the Volkswagen's rear-mounted engine.
So as you're driving down the road, - this propeller is turning.
- A bit.
- Have you rung the Highways Department - Yes.
and told them that you're driving a car with a blender on the back? And there was another issue.
- This is your hull.
- Yes, it is.
- These are holes in it.
- Fiberglass holes for the wheels to stick out.
I've seen Titanic.
Got a hole in it.
Sank.
No, but I've sealed them around the arches with foam.
- If Titanic had been filled with foam - Fine.
it would have been here today.
- They didn't know that then.
Technology.
Fiberglass hole predominantly.
It barely tips the scale over five tonnes.
- Cooling? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah, there's that.
Jeremy showed off his handiwork.
- You've set fire to it? - There was a small fire.
- What? - The welding.
And then while waiting for James Ambitious! Thinking of what to occupy yourself with whilst out on the water not sinking.
- Whilst you sink again.
- No, not this time.
- It will.
- It won't.
- It will.
- It just won't.
Some time much later, James arrived in a flurry of déja vu.
- It's the same vehicle.
- The same car.
- Well, not exactly, but - No, exactly the same car.
It is the same car, and the reason for that is my car, if you remember, worked.
It didn't.
Every time you got to a low bridge, your mast was Ah, now I have a collapsible mast.
And I have a spinnaker.
And I also have a keel-cum-centerboard How did you get that underneath it? You drop it down through the slot like you do on a dinghy.
- Have you seen this? - That's where the water will be.
The water will just simply What's the word? Come through there.
- And you'll sink.
- No, I won't.
- I've calculated it using Archimedes.
- What's a spinnaker? When a body is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upthrust equal in magnitude to the mass of the fluid displaced.
This won't work.
We'd soon find out.
- Thank you so much.
Here's our challenge.
- Come on, then.
- Is it bad? - Yes.
- No, really bad.
- Go on, then.
You will now drive to Dover.
No, not And then you will cross the Channel to France.
That's the sea.
- What is it, 22 miles? - He's not making it up.
Mine won't do that.
If I'd known it was the sea, I'd have fitted a bigger anchor.
- That's not really a sea-going anchor.
- And a longer chain.
I'm not gonna need that.
- No, this'll sink in 30 feet.
- I'm not sure.
- It will sink.
We're all going to be killed.
- No.
- We're going to be killed.
- No.
Mine's a dinghy and dinghies sail across the Channel every day.
I'm 47 years old.
I'm going to be run down by a Korean grain carrier, minced Yeah, but what a day! Before we could set off, James had to take down his new collapsible mast.
Timber! Oh, my God! Um France, here we come.
- What's it caught on? - The security camera.
So would you admit that your design is already flawed? No.
Oh, Christ.
Finally we were on the road, and it soon became clear that all the additions had taken the edge off my Nissank's performance.
Come on! Mind you, why was I hurrying? I'm just gonna ring the solicitor, do my last will and testament, leave everything to the lifeboat people.
I can't believe they're asking us to go across the Channel in them.
I'm following Jeremy's pick-up and it looks like a man with a pick-up who's stolen an outboard motor and two oil drums on the way to a fishing trip.
James, as usual, had fallen behind, but otherwise all was well in his world.
This is fantastic.
I absolutely cannot wait to try out my Triumph Herald in its newly re-rigged form and sail across the Channel.
Why shouldn't it work? I had just one crumb of comfort.
This time, mine was working on the road.
But then the crumb went away.
Oh.
Oh.
Unfortunately, solving the not-floating problem with foam means you get another one, which is choking.
Urgh.
Then Jeremy arrived.
Hammond is being killed and mine is Well, it's hard to know, is that smoke or # And we jolly sailor boys were up, up aloft - Well done.
- Ooh, dear.
Yeah.
What what you've done is fill your engine bay with foam.
Hold on.
And it's caught fire.
- Yeah, OK.
How's your engine? - Ruined.
Every single thing we do - James? Where is he? He isn't even here! - I don't know.
Hoping that the hot exhaust would burn away the foam without it becoming a big ruinous fire, we pressed on.
God, look at them.
They are worse than they were last time on the road.
And we've got a much bigger challenge on the water.
Mind you, after five miles Hammond was beyond caring.
It is like the West Indian dope-smoking team practicing in the car.
Hello! Eventually the excess foam did burn off, and soon we arrived in Dover.
- Keep on looking.
- Yeah.
You know, one day they're gonna want one.
We would be launching from the slipway once used by the giant cross-channel hovercrafts.
Spread before us was Dover harbor, and beyond the safety of its walls the busiest shipping lane in the world.
My fishing rods! Amazingly, the only things that did actually break on the Nissank's journey to Dover were all its brakes.
I'm telling you, James, I cannot stop it.
I can't stop it! By the time James had fixed his rudder, we were running late and the tide was coming in.
- It's ten to eight.
- Yeah? - It's 22 miles.
- Mm.
If mine worked, that's 25 minutes.
- How fast do you think it goes? - Forty knots.
Get off! Have you seen the size of the engine? - Your top speed? - Very slow.
- Four knots? - Yeah.
- A three-knot tide.
It's a mile an hour.
- Yeah.
- And you? - Twenty knots.
Just No, James.
Look, the point is, I'm the only one with even a vague hope of getting there before nightfall.
Why don't we just go when the tide's going out? Then it'll help us.
- That's a good idea.
- That's tomorrow.
- No, slack water.
- Slack water, yeah? Slack water is tomorrow about one o'clock.
- We shall go then.
- Yes.
- We'll go to the pub now.
- Sound idea, yeah.
We'll go to the pub now, and then tomorrow, one o'clock that'll be us at slack water.
Cos the water's slack.
What's slack water? We shall see We will see.
Honestly, crossing the Channel has got to be just about the stupidest idea ever.
You had that sense, "I'm gonna end up today with hypothermia, attached to a stomach pump.
" - Just awful.
- We were all so paranoid about sinking.
We put all that foam everywhere to make them float better.
We wrapped it round the manifold, round the exhaust, round the engine.
Round anywhere really hot, basically, which is why there was all that smoke pouring out.
Anyway, it's now time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
My guest tonight was once suspended from Channel 4 for using the F-word on live television before the watershed.
I mean for 's sake.
Ladies and gentlemen, Jools Holland! Wow.
- This is something! - Lovely to see you! Yes.
He looks like Richard Hammond.
He's so small and dinky.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you very much.
I shall.
- Now, you're the size of Richard Hammond.
- Yes.
But looking into your past life, old British motorbikes, you play the piano.
You view foreign food with suspicion.
You say that people shouldn't go abroad on their holidays.
Spend it in the shed.
Separated at birth, I think, from James May.
What a lovely fellow he is.
What a talented and and great mind that man has.
It's very hard, though, for me to reconcile these views with how I first remember seeing you on The Tube, which was, of course, complete anarchy.
Well, that was in early, happy days.
In many ways, that was the first time that television was put into the hands of the lunatics.
Now things have changed, but that was the first time it sort of happened, and, um we made it up as we went along, and it was live, and it was Friday, it was 5:30, the pubs were open.
- You had to do your interviews in a minute? - That was the other thing.
Because it was youth television, I suppose, the beginning of youth television, they thought everybody's attention span was that long so you had only a minute.
We had Miles Davis, one of the great sort of jazz legends of all time, come up, and he was he'd been promoting his drawings.
So they said, "You've got a minute to interview him.
" I said, "But he's like one of the most biggest names in jazz ever.
Surely "You know, surely he's worth more than a minute.
" They said, "All right, you can have a minute and 20.
" So I sat and I said to him, "Well, Mr.
Davis" He's got these great sunglasses.
He's sitting there.
I said I said, "Would you connect your art to your music?" And he said, "Mm" Would I connect my art to my music? Ignore the pain.
"Er yeah.
"That's a good question.
" - Ah! - So I don't want to interrupt.
And he said, "Would I connect my art to the music? "Good" Then the woman behind They probably have them here.
- No, we don't.
- This is quite a long story.
Then she's going, "Five" It's going down to no time at all.
Then it's like this, and he says, "Yeah.
" part of the punk era.
Do you miss the gobbing? I mean, if this were 1978, they would just be spitting on us.
- It would be a hailstorm of gob.
- Yes.
- But it was a compliment at the time.
- It was.
- And then - Feel free to gob on us.
That was back then, back in the day.
Then our manager Miles Copeland said, "What you do to ingratiate yourselves with anybody who's doing that, "look, I've some tins of beer at the side of the stage, hand the tins of beer out.
" So we did that and then once they'd had the beer, they chucked the empty tins back.
You even met Joey Ramone.
- Does anyone know who he is? - Yeah.
Yes, you see, that's one person and that's enough, cos this is the BBC.
We're not going for ratings, we're going for the one man over there.
What was it like? We were playing in this club called CBGBs, which was a fantastic punk club, and after we finished the Ramones said, "Do you want to come down to this club?" This very nice place called KZ's.
So we went there and I really have never been to anywhere like it before or since.
In each and every room there was an orgy or drug-taking.
Some absurd scenes.
Like one of those strange films of Caligula or something.
Never seen anything like it.
Anyway, I was standing talking to one of the Ramones.
I looked down, and I was very surprised to see that there was one of the womenfolk of New York er performing an act upon his person.
And do you know, he rather lost interest in what I was saying? Unfortunately, we must now stop.
No, we mustn't.
I tell you something, You've got this new album out.
Well, I've done a lot of collaborations with people, and it's the best ones.
We've got a clip of it.
Just to show how many people this guy actually plays with.
Sorry about the telly but here we go.
Play the tape.
# Tell me # Where have all the good guys gone # And you can take a horse to the water # But you can't make it drink # 0h, no, oh, no # 0h, no Just everybody.
My only regret is that you're not there playing the drums.
Trust me, there would have been people wrapping their keyboards around me if I'd have been trying to keep time.
- Now cars.
- Motors.
Now you're talking.
The thing that fascinates me is I heard that you choose a car on how it smells.
Very important.
For instance, I've got an Austin Westminster.
- Mm.
- Bought entirely because of its smell.
I don't know how they ever caught anybody in it.
And you wind down the window just this much and then Law & Order 1965.
It's beautiful.
- That's what it smells of, Law & Order? - Exactly, yeah.
- So what other cars have you got? - An old Aston Martin.
They're quite fun.
- You've got an E-type? - Yes.
I always like Jags.
I feel Jags they're so kind of wonderful to drive.
The V12 Jaguar engine is to this day the smoothest engine that there has ever been, and I've done the threepenny bit test on all of them.
You get the threepenny bit, you place it on top of the engine Mm-hm.
Threepenny bit's not rhyming slang now? We're talking - That's right, yes.
It matters little.
- Cos that would be an amazing thing to do.
- Whatever comes to hand.
- What a test! It'll stand there and you can rev it up, doesn't bat an eyelid.
And of course you're a member of a great many classic car clubs, as I understand.
Let's see.
The E-type Club, the Jaguar.
They're marvelous.
Philip Porter.
Fantastic club.
The Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts'.
The Bentley Drivers Club.
Very good for spare parts.
And you can get a Bentley Drivers Club dressing gown, which you can only You get a Porsche pipe.
Only recognizable by another Bentley Drivers Club person if you're in dressing gowns together.
That's a real worry, now you've just said that.
You must come out with us one evening.
On one of our noggins and natters and cheese niblets evenings we have.
- Anyway, listen.
Your lap.
- Oh.
Your first attempt not that good.
- Who'd like to see his first attempt at a lap? - Yeah.
Let's have a look at this.
Here we go.
Coming up to the first corner.
A lot of speed being carried in there, I would say.
Yes.
- I just thought - Yes.
I just liked the way you just kept going, cos I don't think the brake lights went on.
- Well - Here we go, look.
No, lookl This is this is finel Exactly.
Well, I'm very much built for comfort, not for speed.
Well, I like I have to say that any man who drives with that kind of enthusiasm and bravery, you get a good lap out of them.
Well, I don't know.
I was rather nervous.
Good.
Shall we have a look at the lap? - Yeah.
- Play the tape.
That's a good aggressive start.
I want to see the first corner.
Did you learn your lesson? Yeah it's pretty quick.
No, braking in now.
That was quite abrupt.
Mm.
Oh You just said that before the watershed.
I'd forgotten that the I'd forgotten that I was being miked up in there.
Yeah.
Did you like the car? - Fantastic.
What a car.
- Isn't it? There's a gear there somewhere.
Exactly.
Ho-hol We saw you looking.
And into the Hammerhead.
Yes.
That's that's very good.
That's excellent.
That's a properly good line through there.
Coming up to the Follow-through.
Were you flat out? It's frightening, that part.
That's why it's called the Follow-through.
And through the tires.
Yes, it's looking good.
That's the second-to-last corner.
Most people get it wrong.
You've held it on nicely.
Coming up to the last corner.
And there we are.
Across the line.
Now, where do you think you came on the board of shame? - Where I've always dreamed of being.
- Yeah, well.
Look, this is the keyboard man.
I think my birthday's around the same time as him, so I put myself next in keyboard corner there.
Keyboard corner? No, you're way faster than that.
I'm delighted to say you did it in one forty-nine - Oh! point nine.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is a great time.
It is.
There! I'm not surely, surely not faster than Steve Coogan? Faster than Steve Coogan.
No, that's a very good time.
- Listen, it's been great fun having you.
- It's been lovely here.
Squeeze and The Tube and music and cars as well.
- Jools Holland! - Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That's great.
OK, now back to tonight's big challenge.
The three of us have built amphibious cars.
We've driven them down to Dover with only one or two small fires on the way.
When we left the action, we were preparing to sail them across the Channel to France.
The last time we tried amphibious cars we were flummoxed by a small reservoir in Staffordshire.
This time we faced not just 22 miles of open sea, but the busiest shipping lane in the world.
Nevertheless, we were due to set sail at something called slack water.
It was a lovely morning, and the sea inside the harbor was calm and inviting.
Despite the roughness, Captain Cocksure was supremely confident in his engineering and eager to get going.
Hammond and I, however, weren't.
Have you ever considered the meaning of life? No, but I I think we should.
- And now's the time.
- Yeah, yeah.
This is ready.
I've checked it for watertightness.
I've got all the sheets, which is the nautical term for these pieces of string, in position.
It is all absolutely shipshape and ready to go.
- How many grains of sugar are there there? - That's what I was That's We say blithely, "I'll have one sugar.
" How many are there? - One.
- Yeah.
Two.
- Hundred and eighteen.
- Two.
- Hundred and nineteen.
- Three.
- You started again? - Yeah, I lost count.
I want to get it right.
We have to go.
That thing's gonna leave.
Then the harbor's empty.
I want to go.
Finally they arrived back.
You're two and three quarter hours late.
- No.
Slack water is in - Lot of stuff to do.
nowish.
Listen, before we set off, I've just got a few more things to do.
The night before while a bit drunk, I'd stuck hydrofoil bin lids to the side of my pick-up and I needed to make sure the glue had set.
But James wouldn't wait.
Right, I'm going.
- He's going.
He's going.
- He's off! He's doing it.
It's a car.
It's still a car.
It's a boat.
Sail.
Gib sail.
You're coming back now.
It's a car again.
Centerboard.
- He's got no rudder in the water.
- It's that way.
Oh, yeah.
And Dame Ellen May had another problem.
The centerboard's stuck.
He's got further that way than he has that way.
I'm enjoying this.
I was so preoccupied with my centerboard, I wasn't looking where I was going.
Oh, my.
He's going to hit the pier.
Here comes a rescue boat.
You're being rescued after what? A minute and a half.
It's so unfair.
The rescue boat nudged me back to open water, where I discovered my Archimedes calculations were a bit out.
I would say that car's sinking as well.
Mayday! He's going down, I think we should get in there.
This can only go well.
Here we go.
Oh, yeah! Once again, the pick-up truck is working.
Yes! It works! I am floating! Amazingly, all three of us were floating.
Well, when I say three It's going down.
Richard offered to pick James up but he had a problem.
- You can't stop? - No, I can't stop the engine.
- See you, then! - Oh, bloody hell! - Do you want to come on this boat? - Up to a point, yes.
Will you admit it's a brilliant piece of design? - No, bugger off.
- Goodbye.
Richard and I returned to land, because we wanted to be there to offer James reassurance and sympathy.
You designed a rubbish car and you know nothing about sailing.
Amazingly, however, James insisted that his Herald and the snapped mast could be fixed.
And so, with help from me and Jeremy, two hours later he was back in business.
Here we go.
Let's go! This is absolutely brilliant! I'm actually using my weight to counter the roll of the craft.
Ow.
Is that your top speed? I'm flat out.
Even so, I was a lot faster than James.
So Jeremy and I left him behind and pretty soon we were at the mouth of the harbor facing the open sea.
That's choppy out there.
I can't do that.
Not not in a van.
Mate, it's horrible! Maybe if we snuck up on it Yeah, sneak up on the sea, that's brilliant.
Meanwhile, back with Captain Pugwash Sod it.
Right, now, sail.
Ow.
Ah! Ah! We were leaving the harbor.
You can't see what's coming.
I can.
Help! I can just see sky, sea, sky, sea! Ha-ha-ha! Whoa! My God! This is big now! Quite scared! Quite scared! Quite really scared! Why the bloody hell won't it turn round? Ow.
That thing.
Whoa! It's coming through the sun roof! I'm gonna try and turn.
Bloody hell.
Ooh! - These are quite big.
- Don't like that! Don't turn on a wave.
- Wait or something.
- I don't know, I got scared! - Oh, my God.
- Agh! No, no, no! In seas like this and with my puny power, I bravely decided to head back to the harbor.
And then Jeremy bravely followed suit.
Mayday.
Ow! Is it not working well, James? Have you ever heard of the milk of human kindness? Well, prepare to suckle on it.
Thank you.
Sorry, mate.
As Jeremy rescued James, I realized that the big seas had damaged my precious craft.
My steering's broken.
I just go in faster circles.
I was stuck in the entrance to the harbor.
Oh, my God, there is the Seacat.
He can move.
But he continued on course and now James was a sitting duck as well.
No time to lose.
- What do you want me to do? - Just nudge the front gently back to port.
I can't get in! Come on, you bitch! I don't I can't do gently.
That's not around, that's backwards, you pillock.
I don't want to go that way now! Go left! And then Oh, not another one! Never in maritime history has a ship had to dodge so much flotsam and jetsam while coming into Dover.
- Sorry, it was him.
Sorry.
- Sorry.
And this made us be in trouble.
Morning, Officer.
Yeah, fine, thank you.
Everything's under control.
We were ordered back to land but getting there wasn't easy.
Mate, my engine is letting go.
It's dying.
There's no doubt about it.
The Herald was towed back.
Again.
Gently! And I pulled Richard in.
That's humiliating.
- So we set out for France twice.
- Yeah.
- And - We made Dover.
James' boat was now beyond repair.
But luckily Jeremy was on hand to comfort him.
You failed! Thank you.
Third attempt.
Here we go.
Today the wind had dropped and the sea was much calmer.
We're going to France.
This time we are going.
I was now powered by an outboard I'd bought from Jeremy for a million pounds.
And James was my cabin boy.
If you'd go below, please, Roger the Cabin Boy, - and a cup of tea.
- Aye aye, sir.
Oi, Prescott! I'll have a bacon sandwich! Richard's million-pound outboard wasn't exactly gutsy.
So in the spirit of the sea and in keeping with the maritime code, I gunned it and left them behind.
Left.
Oh, she's riding the waves like a twig.
Meanwhile back on the cabin cruiser Bloody hell! May! - What? - There's quite a lot of water.
- It's up to - Oh, not again.
As you can see this morning, the sea is a millpond.
We're hoping to capitalize on that and make good progress before the waves build up, which they inevitably will.
This is the third time I've been in this bloody sea.
Yeah.
Tech technically, it wasn't my fault.
I'm disappointed.
I thought we were gonna make it.
Sorry, mate.
The cap sank.
With typical good grace, Jeremy came back to pick us up and then announced we'd have to go back to Dover.
This seemed like a waste of time.
But as we lined up for our fourth attempt, his reasoning became clear.
A couple of years ago, Richard Branson set a record for crossing the Channel in an amphibious car.
One hour, forty minutes, six seconds.
And? No way! It's an average speed of 10.
8 knots.
- What, so we go for it? We give it a shot? - In Calais for lunch.
Beardy! You're going down! Guys, can I ask one question? - What? - Where's France? We follow the ferry.
But not the one going to Holland.
Soon the three men in a boat were an incredible two miles from England.
And since we were going for a record, we had to work out our speed.
This is our speedometer.
We've tied knots in a row.
You throw it in and you see how many pass through your fingers in a given time.
- It's a very accurate system.
- Captain? Cap'n.
About 110 knots.
Er 125.
Because we were blasting along at a steady 125 miles an hour we had a visit from the coastguard.
This is the UK Coastguard.
Please state your intentions, please.
Our intentions are to go across the Channel faster than beardy Branson.
In that case, I wish you good luck and bon voyage.
I want to do that for a job.
That's brilliant.
I mean, all you do is jump out and wrestle Albanians.
Amazingly, our vessel plowed on without mishap.
And then Land ahoy! France! We can see France! On a pick-up truck! Mind you, Jeremy, do you want to be depressed? - What? - Look at England.
Boldly going further than any pick-up had gone before, we were soon in the shipping lanes.
Bloody hell.
What do we do now? We can't remember whose right of way it is.
That's on what's called a constant bearing as well, which means we're gonna hit it.
Oh, God, no! I'm thinking I'll maybe go behind it.
- Yeah, I'd go behind it.
- Yeah.
I think behind it is best.
Having missed all the big scary boats, we turned our attention back to Branson's record.
Ready? Ready? One hour forty minutes coming up now! - We've failed! - We lost! Now it was just a question of seeing if we could make it, but with eight miles to go it started to get choppy.
- We're going down, boys.
- Aah! It's pouring in.
Oh, my God.
Look in there now.
I don't like that! We're in big trouble.
Things were even worse at the back.
We're taking on a hell of a lot of water.
So we sent James to the front to act as ballast.
I'm getting a bit bored with sinking, frankly.
Mercifully, as we got into the lee or something or other, the waters calmed and we could taste success.
The town of Sangatte was about to get three more immigrants.
Never mind that we'd aimed for Calais and missed.
France is France.
Come on, come on! We're 20 yards from France.
To succeed, we had to get up the boat ramp, but that meant going through the breakers.
Aah! Aaah! Where's that come from? Help! I really thought we were gonna tip over.
We're on the rocks.
We're going up the beach now.
Skilfully, James got a rope round the front bumper and in a gap in the waves I went for it.
No! That's good.
The pick-up had landed.
Merci bien! Merci bien!


Tonight, James drives a Rolls-Royce, Richard drives a Bugatti Veyron, and I drive something that isn't either of those things Hello.
Good evening.
Good evening and thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
Thanks.
Now We start tonight with a letter: "Dear Top Gear, why, oh, why don't you feature more cars aimed at ordinary people like me? Yours sincerely, Mr.
R.
Abramovich of Chelsea.
" Well, Mr Abramovich, our man of the people, James May, was only too happy to oblige.
Perhaps this is what he's on about.
No, not the gin palace.
This.
The new Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead.
As I'm sure you know, on Top Gear, if a car spends too long sitting on the deck of an aircraft carrier, it eventually gets launched off the ramp thing down at the end.
And this definitely isn't going to fly because it weighs 2.
6 tonnes.
So, let's be on our way.
This really isn't the sort of car you want to drop into the ocean Largely because it costs 307,000 pounds.
That's 50,000 more than the Rolls-Royce Phantom Saloon which we tested a few years ago, and which, I have to say, we liked rather a lot.
So, what are you paying the extra for, aside from the drop-top? Well, you certainly get a lot more metal-working because, to keep the Drophead's body rigid, Rolls gave it to their adoptive parents at BMW who added another 460 feet of welding.
And they did that at their Centre For Aluminium Competence.
I'm not making that up, that is what it's called.
They're Germans.
Otherwise, it has the same 6.
75 litre engine as the Phantom, the same top speed and the same 0-60 time.
So, the mechanicals are the same.
But the image, very different.
The saloon is the sort of car that you could hide in.
You can sit in the back behind the tinted glass and just pretend to be selling Russian gas or whatever on your laptop.
But with the Drophead, it will be you who's doing the driving.
You don't really want to ride in the back of this car, unless, perhaps, you're the Queen of England or Elton John.
Which is the same thing, really.
So, you'll be sitting up front, for all the world to see, in a car that's hardly discreet, and this is why I'm driving it around town at night: because the producer thought I'd be too embarrassed in daylight.
But why would I be embarrassed? If this was truly vulgar, maybe, but it isn't.
It's exquisite.
This lot don't do carbon fibre but they will let you have this teak decking at the back, like you might find on a motor launch.
And they will also let you have the bonnet finished in brushed stainless steel.
And other car manufacturers are currently spending millions and millions of pounds on research into hydrogen fuel cells and hybrid drive but Rolls-Royce spends the same money in its ashtray design department.
Look at that! Furthermore, you won't be overwhelmed by all the flashing lights and gizmos and gadgets that you'd find in a BMW 7 Series or a Maybach.
I don't have ten different settings for the ride firmness, I don't have five different speeds at which the interior lights switch off when I close the door.
It's more like a butler, this car.
It just sort of takes care of everything for you and you don't even notice.
Like the Phantom Saloon, the Drophead doesn't follow the herd.
It has its own ideas about what a luxury car should be.
You can't order a sports pack or a flappy-paddle gearbox but you CAN choose from 44,000 shades of paint.
You know that teak decking? When you take the car for a service a man in an apron oils it for you, like you might your favourite cricket bat.
And when it rains, yes, you call on an old-fashioned soft-top, instead of some trendy, folding, metal origami.
But that soft-top is lined with cashmere.
And yet, for all its teak and stainless steel and cashmere, the Drophead just doesn't come across as brash, or in-your-face.
I like to think you could leave it in the rougher parts of town and no-one would hurt it.
Yo! I love you! Let's not try it out, though, eh? This is, without doubt, a proper Rolls-Royce.
Wonderful to drive, beautifully made.
But there's something else.
Here's an amazing thing.
Rolls-Royce is the most established marque in the history of motoring.
It has the most pompous radiator grille.
It has the most ridiculous mascot.
And yet, this car's very, very cool.
I think this might be the coolest car in the world.
You said it wasn't brash? Yeah, it's not like clock too tall I'd better say I'm with you, it's an exquisite car.
Trouble is, though.
When the roof comes back, You know, a cloche in a stupid restaurant, when they go, "Ta-daaa!" Oh yeah, "any more convertible at all?" Yes, I know, and you sit You sit in the damn thing and it's like sitting in a convertible Range Rover, you sit high up.
You feel so conspicuous! I didn't feel conspicuous in it.
The thing is, I believe, deep in my heart, that I looked good in it, and it suits me, 'Cos it's stylish and it's contemporary.
Every time I see you those are the words that pop into my head: Stylish and contemporary! After other words, like, for instance beige! Standard stairlift The War, wanna hear any more? Homosexual! I object to the beige! Now, the news.
Imagine if you will that you bought a Bugatti Veyron, It's a big investment You'd be very excited about the day it was gonna be arrived, So you'd imagine such a thing would be delivered You know, on like a golden carriage, on a bed of swan's feathers, it's a special moment.
I'd want mine born aloft by sixteen greased, naked eunuchs That's what I'd want.
Whatever, the point is that's the sort of thing you'd expect, it's a big moment In Russia they do things a little bit differently Here is one, it's being transported That's a Bugatti! I brrought yourr Bugatti, sirr, it is herre Why is it on a flatbed pickup? Your?????? That's a disappointment in your life.
Now, anyone parked in London recently? No.
You see, the problem is no more parking meters are pay'n'display.
What you do is you pull up and there's a sign, we've got a picture of one here Ok? Where you pay by phone for your parking space.
Would anybody like me to try that? Ok.
I have brought with me all you need: got a phone, and a credit card These are what you need, ok? I've got a microphone so you can hear what I'm doing.
- Just give me the number.
0-8 - 7-0 - 7-0, yep - 4-2-8 4-2-8 4-00-9.
4-00-9.
This puts me through to a laptop in India Here you go.
Got the microphone ready, I'll put the speaker on.
Brooke to Westminster Option Service Please enter the FOUR-digit location number or entry ???? to select your last location.
Right.
So it's 8 that's the location.
8-7-44 Your car's rotting at this point Here we go, there we are Insert your PIN number or the last four digits of the credit or debit card which you registered.
My credit card! Last four I can't read them, I need gla You can't if you ain't got any glasses - Give it to me, I'll read your number out loud - Someone will have to read it for you - All of them - No, you won't do that Someone's got some reading glasses? That's Oh yes! They're not reading glasses! No, there we go 7 This is to park your car! Hey, I haven't finished yet! Please, press the key on which the first character of your numberplate resides Ei? Somebody give me a registration number of one of these cars That Ferrari, was it V12? V V! For T press 1, For U press 2 For V Nooo!! You gotta go through the whole numberplate, pressing hundreds of thousands of numbers! I promise faithfully, the other day I was in London, I used an entire charge Numberplate retype Shut up! I used an entire charge of battery Just to get halfway through the number and the battery died.
Had to go into a shop, buy a car charger, come back, then finally you get through a man that goes: "It's all right, the system doesn't work.
" He actually admitted it doesn't work, no one can do it.
We've got to do something about Ken Livingstone.
It's his fault.
- obviously - I have this plan Bring him down here, all right? And set fire to him.
Well, that's brilliant! That would do it! That would get rid of him Well, look.
Look! This is the problem we've got.
This You know we accidentally lit some pipes last week.
A bit A hysterical woman, who runs some hysterical organization, thin lips, the sort that take their own lunch to work, You know the sort? She got in touch and she pointed out, after having "DEMANDED an apology from the BBC" She pointed out that, you can't smoke anything now in the studio.
Anything.
doesn't matter if it's herbal or tobacco, you're not allowed to.
which means it is now illegal to inhale the Mayor of London if he's on fire.
What if we turf him? Turf him? Is that some euphemism from those "special clubs" you go? You see a nice bloke in a leather hat, "I'd love to turf him.
" - It's not? - No! All right.
No, it isn't I'm thinking of that artist I can't remember his name, who turfs buildings and statues Where do you live?! He does it in London, he did it in the South Bank, we turf Ken Livingstone, stick him on a plynth, job done.
Oh, now, word of warning, You know you can now buy radar-guided cruise-control with your car.
First to test it was Mercedes, and I liked it very much.
The idea is you You set the cruise control Go along with the speed.
If a car pulls out along in front of you Your car sees it, slows you down to speed it's going, when it pulls over, you accelerate back up to the speed you selected, ok? I thought it was great, but I tried a Volvo this week.
What it does when it slows down when someone is apply the brakes and the brake lights come on.
Actually, putting the brakes to slow you down is very clever.
Nononono, you should never apply the brakes on a motorway.
- Well, it's - It's the brake lights what cause all the tailbacks, People who can't maintain a constant speed.
You know what I mean? Those people that drive I'm braking, I've accelerated too close, I'd had police marksmen shoot them in the head for doing that I have never braked on a motorway.
What if something's in the way? What if somebody swerves and you're going you You see them coming.
If it's an old Rover, you know it's being driven by a man with ears the size of a satellite dish, and you don't ever need to brake, you just prepare yourself.
Do you know the game, if you ever played the "I Have Never" game You think of things, you know, round the table, I've never never braked never bought anything in Marks&Spencer, And then if you're losing you go for the "I've never used a tampon.
" That's a winner I remember that, too.
I have.
You've used a tampon - Yeah.
- Are you sure? You know, spillage.
Oh, mate, what? I had a bit of an accident on the cooker once Sorry, this is getting worse! No, hear me out When you're boiling something, something with milk in it, and it, you know, it boiled over, and it goes in that bit of the back where you can't get your finger in, and if you don't clean it up If you don't clean that out it goes rancid and it smells forever.
You used tampons to clean a cooker?! 'Cos I couldn't get my finger in it! He doesn't have OCD! Listen, no You do have OCD! I don't! You know the bezel on the watch? You know the little arrow thing here? If I have it here, it's fine.
But if I put it round Ready? There It's like kryptonite.
Go back in the wrong position.
You can't you can't bear it if I haven't got that arrow Look! Do I say the other interesting thing about tampons? Seriously, if you've got Has anybody got like an old twin-cylinder motorcycle? Parallel twin.
You'll know this.
- You'll always get a little bit of oil - I WILL NOT! You will You'll get a little bit of oil that always leaks out through the seal, when you close it, and you can't get at it to mop it up.
Allright, you put a lilac on the end of a screwdriver Phillips, - Shake it gone.
- You carry them with you on a bandolier round like a Swcharzenegger arrangement, full of tampons just in case.
It's a new application for an existing technology.
- I'm adapting to - James, go away Watch out I can't stand that - Somebody - He can't bear it He honestly cannot bear it if I do that.
Anyway, pray silence now, please, for the most breathtaking car we've ever had here in our studio.
Here is the new Lamborghini ReventÃ³n.
RebentÃ³n.
No, it's ReventÃ³n.
No, no, RebentÃ³n No, it's ReventÃ³n, I can prove it: It's got It's got a 'V': ReventÃ³n.
No, I know it's spelt with a V, but it's pronounced with a B.
Why? Don't know, they told us.
It's B: ReBentÃ³n.
Anyway, it has a 6.
5 litre V12 B12.
Yeah, whatever It can do Whateber Please, stop Stop, that's very annoying.
It can do 212 - Bery annoying - Leave it!! It is an awe-inspiring car.
It is, and honestly, I'm with you.
It's styled to look like an F-22 Raptor, you know, the new stealth fighter.
And it really does, it's This is what Lamborghini should be doing: Making cars where you just go Just fantastic! And it's not just on the outside, it's clever inside, too.
We've got some pictures here The dashboard is a thin liquid film transistor like you get on aircraft.
That's on car setting.
If we switch it now to aircraft setting Look at that! I want that in my life It's just covered in things you want! Round here, the rear lights, LEDs in little arrow shapes.
These enormous fans down here, behind these grilles.
And round here, the wheels.
They've got carbon fibre fins on them that act as a giant fan to suck in cold air to cool the brakes.
And just Just a fuel-filler cap, look at that! Couple of problems: One, they're only making 20, only one is coming to Britain.
The other thing is: 800,000 pounds.
That is quite a lot.
But with this you would get a lot of badge.
Badge? Think we got away with that So, let's move on to Ferrari.
Now, in the olden days, they used to build their racing cars with a lot of passion.
and enthusiasm, and then, on lap three, they would explode as often as not in a passionate and enthusiastic fireball.
But then, a few years ago, they started building their racing cars with science and Maths.
And since then, as we know, they've been top of the tree.
So now, Ferrari is putting science and Maths into its road cars as well This is the 599.
It has a six-litre V12 with variable valve timing on each of its four cams and magneto-rheological shock absorbers.
It has lights on the steering wheel telling you when to change gear and then there's the gearbox itself.
When I pull this paddle here, the clutch disengages, the cogs are swapped and the clutch re-engages, all in 100 milliseconds.
Ready Yeah, 100 milliseconds.
See that diffuser at the back? That's generating 165 kgs of downforce, That is That's about that much You can't even start this car in the normal way.
To get it off the line, you pull that paddle to put it in No! No.
Wait.
You turn the traction control off, yeah, that's that done, then you pull this paddle, to put it in first.
Then you press the launch control button, Now the L's flashing, and then you put your left foot on the brake, build up the revs Then you take your foot off the brake That was hugely impressive.
But I'll let you into a little secret.
Launch control is primarily designed for fat, useless drivers to impress their friends with all the tyre smoke and so on.
There's another, quicker way of getting this car off the line.
Ferrari won't thank me for this, but what you do is: put it in Race OK? Then you hold this paddle down for two seconds.
There it is It says "Transmission Failure", but don't worry.
Left foot on the brake, don't turn the launch control on, build up the revs.
That's phenomenal.
The onboard computer's just got me from 0 to 60 in 3.
5 seconds.
3.
5! in a car that weighs nearly two tons! More amazing still, in the time it takes a two-litre Mondeo to get from 0 to 60, the 599 will get you from 0 to 150! And then there's the way it goes round corners.
What I do in a normal fast car coming round here is brake turn in, you feel the grip, OK? And then you balance the throttle to hold it on the limit of grip, and then you call the tow truck to pull you out of the field.
In this, however, things are a little bit different.
I simply choose what sort of cornering I'd like to do with this little switch.
So, if I put it here I can make it do this.
Or if I put it here, I can make it do this.
Hold onto your spleen, everyone! Or if you're feeling brave and talented, you can turn the system off all together, in which case you'll corner like this.
Oh, dear! Big cloud of smoke! And then it stalls.
To be honest, I don't really like any of this electronic stuff.
I'm not the sort of person who spends his evening on Bebo or Myface, but I will admit when it all comes together, the effect is, um profound.
In short, this does for other cars what the laptop did for the typewriter.
And because it's so high-tech, it's easy to drive.
You might even imagine you could use a 599 for trips to the shops.
But not so fast on that one.
In the past, this was the natural stomping ground of the Ferrari, under a cover, in a garage and with good reason.
The 512 was too difficult and heavy to be used as an everyday car.
The Enzo has problems too.
It was only available with left-hand drive, so if you pulled up at a slightly oblique junction, you couldn't see what was coming.
The 599, though, looks as though it gets round these problems.
There's a parcel shelf in the back for your golf clubs.
Service intervals are every 12,500 miles and because the engine's in the front it has a big boot.
Don't, however, be fooled, because there are one or two little issues.
I took one of these out on the roads near where I live the other day and it was so wide I spent most of my time in the ditch or the hedge trying to avoid people coming the other way.
The headlights were like candles in jam jars, the automatic wipers turned themselves on every time it stopped raining, The air-conditioning system had a mind of its own it kept steaming up.
And the ambient lighting, designed to bathe the interior in a warm glow, lit the whole thing up like a battlefield.
You really couldn't buy a 599 to use every day.
More worryingly, though, I wouldn't buy one at all.
You see, if it's a car you can only really use on special occasions, you want it to feel special.
.
.
and somehow it doesn't.
Technically, it's brilliant.
I respect it hugely, in the same way that I respect the technology in my iPod, but I don't love it.
And that's why if I were gonna blow Â£185,000 on a Ferrari, I'd walk right past the 599 and get one of these: It's a Ferrari 275 GTS.
Even by the standards of the day, 1964, it was rubbish! The prop-shaft, for instance, that links the engine at the front to the gearbox at the back, was never aligned properly, so it'd wear out immediately.
And that was a good thing, actually, because it meant owners didn't have a chance to find out that the brakes were actually milk bottle tops.
They'd stop you once.
And, you know what? None of that matters, because, look at it It's 14 feet of almost nothing but passion and flair and style.
So when you drive it once a year, maybe, it makes you feel special.
The 599 is just a bucket-load of science and maths, this 275 is is what matters.
It's heart and soul.
Look at this.
It is amazing! As a technical exercise, As a technical exercise it's just astonishing.
The science and maths is phenomenal in it, it really is.
And would you really rather have that old 275? Honest to God, I really would.
Anyway, we must now find out how fast this car goes round our track.
Of course, that means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
Some say that he gets terrible eczema on his helmet and that if he'd been the video ref in the World Cup rugby final he would have seen that of course it was a try, you blind Australian halfwit! All we know is, he's called the Stig! And he's off! Lots of smoke there, mostly from the tortured clutch as Stig gives it the beans in the secret Launch mode! First corner.
He turns in hard.
The tyres squeal more roll than you might expect, actually Well that's That is a lot! 'A sixth-sensory person interacts with the world, witnessing energy in a detached mode.
Magneto-rheological dampers sport traction control off, stereo sadly on, though.
Tail just flicking out there, coming into the Hammerhead Very hard on the brakes.
Almost beat the ABS there.
That's a big drift! This may be a V12 Pentium Processor, but God, it can dance! Use that energy to be more giving, more supportive and more effective.
Right, now the full fury of that Enzo engine.
Here it goes.
Powers through the Follow-through, through the tyres.
That is quick, but is it supercar quick or will the 599 softer GT side slow it down? Coming up to Gambon now.
Super tidy through there.
And across the line! Got to remember that we're talking here about a car that weighs nearly two tons, leather seats, air conditioning, big boot and it did it faster than a Ford GT.
1 minute 22.
2 That is truly staggering.
But now we must move on, because it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
My guest tonight holds an amazing record.
He has been seen in the flesh by more people than anyone else in the history of humankind.
And that is because he is a member of a band called the Rolling Stones.
Ladies and gentlemen, Ronnie Wood! Can't believe this.
Hello, mate.
Staggering! All right? I'm very well, how are you? Good.
I guess, um I guess you must be unnerved by a crowd as big as this.
I know, I know 500 people here.
It's nice to be intimate.
It's not intimate, this is huge! Is this true? Cos we were working out the other day What do you get on an average tour these days? How many people come? Oh, God Um Many millions.
I reckon more people than the Pope.
The Pope is nothing Can't see the Pope singing Satisfaction, let's be honest.
Now, I've got to get straight to business here.
You look at the Stones, you've all got good hair.
How can you have known that when you all got together? Well, none of us wanted to be in Fleetwood Mac.
Hair's an important thing why is you know Must be the gypsy blood! I know you're the first member of your family to be born on dry land, is that right? Yeah, me and my two brothers, all the rest of the family right back down to the 1700s that I traced so far were all born on the water.
You all were on - canals rather than? - Yeah, on the canals.
I didn't realise that gipsies were born I thought they were born in caravans, not in narrowboats.
I've got a caravan for the dry land bit.
You're kidding! You've still got a caravan? Yeah, I got a few one in the front and one in the back garden.
Would you like us to destroy them? No, I can do that myself.
Honestly, we would be even better than you at destroying them.
Now, you've got a book out.
- Which is called - Da-dah! You've brought one with you It's called Ronnie.
The one thing, having read it, that fascinates me is, how are you still alive? Good question.
How did you do it? Every single thing that's ever happened in your life would have killed anybody else.
The drugs, the fights even in the early days, when you were with Jeff Beck Yeah, the escapes, the escapes oh, my God, from some motorway cafÃ©.
- What, the Blue Boar days? - Yeah.
Cos all the bands used to meet there after doing gigs, at the Blue Boar, on the M1.
We would ahm be sitting there at the shank of the evening and outside you could see the gangs gathering, you know, and they're going, "We'll have that lot, in the end" - The mods and rockers gangs? - Yeah! And we didn't know which one was gonna attack us, We had to pretend to be on both sides, and also get out of there and make our escape so we had to jump into the car through the window, into the back The full Dukes of Hazzard through the window? Yeah, just the window was luckily wound down because they'd come at you with with baseball bats and whatever other sticks and nails and stuff they could get their hands on.
And Jeff would get behind the driver's seat, and one against the petrol pump, another one against the wall Boom, boom, get out! So Jeff Beck's not only an amazing guitarist, but he's also a getaway driver? He is.
Oh yeah.
This is one of the things I noticed in your friend list, in your book, it's looking at your friends, you've met people like John Belushi, Hendrix All those people they're not exactly a Methodist Bible group.
Which brings us round to our dearly departed friend, Keith Moon, God bless him.
Driving up the steps, straight through the plate glass window and saying, "Could I have my room key, please?" You saw him do that? Yeah, and he pitched a tent in the lobby of the Beverley Wiltshire in Hollywood because they wouldn't let him in, so he said, "I'm staying anyway.
" Oh, look, that's proper There's none of that you wouldn't see Daniel Bedingfield doing that.
What's your record for staying up? 6 days, 6 nights With a concert after everyone.
We would play Madison Square Garden, Keith and I would say, "Well, we might as well make a laugh of it" Let's go down to the studio with Eric Clapton, Let's go down to Electric Lady", so we'd do that every night We'd say, "There's no point in going to bed now, we'll be on in a few more hours".
So that went on second day, third day, Fourth day I said, "Keith, I'm going to rest now" "Nobody sleeps while I'm awake" So we did the extra two days and, before we knew it We had a nice two days' kip.
That's just fantastic And then there was also, not only the danger, obviously, of touring and staying up, Keith Richards obviously was armed a lot of the time as well Yeah, before the good old days of the terrorists, at the airports, you used to be able to carry a piece on with you Did Keith ever shoot anybody or anything? He'd shoot between somebody's legs that he was mad at in his room once, And it went through the ceiling and disturbed an old people's card game in the room below.
Why do we all have the jobs we have? Why aren't we all in bands? Didn't he shoot somebody's guitar once? Yeah, which turned out to be his own guitar! He thought it was Mick's, and he was mad at Mick and said, I'll shoot his guitar So he got a pillow, And I said to a roadie, "Oh, what we're gonna tell Mick?" He said, "Don't worry, he borrowed it from Keith anyway" Reading the book I was thinking, OK, you lived through that, you lived through the fights, you lived through the 60s and the mods and the rockers, you lived through the drugs, you lived through all the drink.
But when you taped over your wedding video, Why did you have to bring that out for? Nearly an early divorce.
Did you actually kill him for that? You nearly did.
It's only the last bit of it, you know in the old days with videos, you'd hit STOP and it would go back about Yeah a foot, or something So We're getting into Joe singing "And then he kissed me" at the wedding reception.
and then suddenly, ??? Ok, now, there's one thing that I think we all have in our heads, really about the Stones is that you have absolutely no idea about how the world works any more You just live in this incredible separate existance.
Is that the case or are you in touch with how the world goes? Well, it is difficult being on tour and you know, going to the office with a police escort and private planes, and It's pretty hard to adjust, coming off.
I just find it so very difficult to imagine a Rolling Stone Can't imagine Mick driving a car.
I can't imagine him knowing what the levers where for.
I can't see Charlie driving, either, Has he got a driving license? No.
Oh, he hasn't.
So he's got no cars.
He owns a wonderful Lagonda.
He's got a collection of rare old cars and he likes to hear the sound of the engine, but not rev it up.
Don't like to rev it up.
Or go anywhere in it.
He gets suits made of the same design as the car, you know, it's sort of maroon and grey, with stripes and something, and sits in it, He's an eccentric.
I love the idea of being him, You're just so I do have, In Ireland I do have my old 6.
3 Mercedes An old one? Yeah, 97, yeah.
Huge, really good looking.
beautiful? With hydraulic - seats and boot-lid and everything? - Yeah.
That's a lovely car, what else have you got? I've got an old Chevrolet 2-seater with dickie seats.
and wooden spoke wheels.
from the 1920s.
Though it really didn't set you up in any way for the Chevrolet that we provided you with today to do the lap.
Is that what it was? Chevrolet Lacetti! Oh! How was it out on the on the circuit? It was fantastic, by the time I did my last lap, I thought, "I could get into this!" Who'd like to see the lap? Play the tape, here we go! Hello, come on, let's go! Ronnie Wood in our Chevrolet.
We gotta think lap times here.
The slowest one ever! Let's have a look.
Is that slow? No, it is not.
Better than Jools Holland.
That was nice.
Brake.
You need to for that corner.
That's looking good as well.
Come on! You old crate! You do need to brake again there.
Liking the braking while understeering, nice and tidy.
Go on, Ronnie, go on, go on! Going into this one nice and fast.
I'm loving this.
This one even faster.
Bloody hell, that is quick! I'll hit this nice too.
I really didn't think you'd be able to do this.
I thought you'd just get lost and not know your name.
It's the last corner again and there he is across the line, everybody! I didn't spin off! I'm staggered! I am genuinely amazed at that.
I'm still shaken.
But you liked it? Yeah, adrenaline.
That's great.
So, where do you think you've come on our lap times board? Even if I came last, I just enjoyed the hell out of it.
Sweet man, but you didn't come last.
Not even close.
You did it in 1 minute 49.
4 seconds.
You, mate, are right Quicker than Jools.
Where's Helen Mirren's name on there? Helen Mirren is there, 1.
52.
8.
Well, that has just been the best fun having you on, honestly.
Ladies and gentlemen, Ronnie Wood! Now, over the years, technology has done a great deal to help old people.
It's given them the Stannah Stairlift, the electric tin opener and the rubberised undersheet.
But there's never been anything to help old people park until now! 'Cause this Lexus LS600 can park itself.
Now, here's basically how it works.
At the back of the car, there are sensors in the bumper that know where its extremes are.
There's a tiny little camera here that looks behind and when Hammond presses a little button on the screen, it will reverse and steer itself into that spot.
Yup, it's that easy.
I just engage reverse gear, I can see the cameras here, I press some buttons and stuff and then it parks! Here goes! This is gonna go well.
Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt but this is the instruction book that I have here, ok? for this command system.
All of that is for the park assist.
You think you can do it without reading it? Well All right, go on, see if I care.
Go on then, go on then.
I don't do anything, I just take my foot off the brake, yeah? Yeah, you take your foot off the brake, and then it goes.
I'm not doing anything, I'm not doing anything, I'm not doing anything! It's just the car! I'm not! Oh, bugger! No! Stop! Stop! You've hit the cool wall! Well, it's new technology Has anyone got any reading glasses? I can't read this damn book.
Thanks, I promise I'll pay you back.
Right.
I've got a green light and I've hit OK.
And, er, right.
If I put my foot on the brake, it slows it down.
Yes, yes! No! No! No, no, no, no, no! The Cool Wall again! I think we set the radar wrong.
We've got to read the book! "A equals B, is less than C" "(A and B are equally far away)" How can old people understand this? Jeremy? What? James? Yes.
Both of you, is the green square important? BOTH: Yes! - What does that green square mean? - It's where you go! Oh, I put that in the cool wall! Ah, I've moved it, I've moved it! It's in the right place now.
So that's where I go.
- Here I go! - He's going, he's going I've got it, I'm not touching anything.
Please, turn.
Please, God, turn! Turn it the other way! - No, I can't touch it! - Turn it the other way! - The car has to do it.
- It's doing it! The car has to do it.
That's nearly in! That's parked! That is nearly there.
Ladies and gentlemen, give the car that nearly did it a round of applause.
And the really tremendous thing about this is: this car is Â£83,000.
The old age pension at the moment is Â£87.
30, which means if you save all your money, do without food and warmth, you will be able to buy one of these in just 18 years.
Who says we don't do sensible consumer advice on this show? And there's more.
Because as the country becomes more and more crowded, and the environmentalists become more and more noisy, it makes more and more sense than ever to have a small car.
There are lots to choose from.
I've got a selection here: Volkswagen Polo, Suzuki Swift quite nice, actually and the Citroen C1.
The trouble is none of these cars are really small.
They are in fact MASSIVE.
40 years ago, car makers could sell you something much smaller: the original Mini, for example, or the bubble car.
But even these aren't small.
Not really.
Not compared to this: the Peel P50.
That is 54 inches long and 41 inches wide.
It's listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the smallest production car ever.
And what I'm sure you're expecting me to do now is introduce Richard Hammond.
But what I'm ACTUALLY going to do is drive it to work.
All, erm, 6'5" of me.
No, that's not gonna work.
I'll have to Hang on.
Leg first and then Yes! Built on the Isle of Man in the early '60s, the P50 was said to be almost cheaper than walking.
It cost Â£198 and did 100 miles to the gallon.
It sounds perfect then, for the roads of today.
Of course, there are one or two drawbacks.
I can't imagine, for instance, that it's terribly safe, not when your knees are the crumple zones.
And nor is it very fast.
What I've got down here by my right knee, in the cabin, making an awful lot of noise and generating quite a bit of heat is the 49cc engine from a moped.
Top speed rather depends on how big you are and, erm actually how much you had for breakfast.
Realistically, even the skinniest, shortest chap with the whitest of teeth will struggle to get past 35? There's something else I've just thought of as well.
I have to pay congestion charge in this in this part of London, but the camera crew in the Lexus 4x4 don't, because it's a "hybrid".
How fair is that? It's not like I'm creating any pollution at all.
The Peel, then, is not only a handy way of getting TO work, but it's also pretty practical when you get there.
Normally, the BBC make you moor up in an underground car park, but the bays are only big enough for ethnic peace bicycles and fairtrade G-Wizzes.
Because this is smaller than an ethnic peace bicycle, I don't have to worry about parking at all.
The great thing about a car this small is that it's very light, which means that when you get to work, you just pick it up and carry it inside.
Morning! In the Top Gear office, the team were keen to know more about the P50.
I give you the future, young men and women! The Peel P50.
I think it's 4.
5 horsepower.
You know those Little Tykes cars that all kids have got? That's exactly the same - one door.
I have never seen the Top Gear team so enthusiastic about any car.
"Lads, I put a Koenigsegg down in the car park Oh, right.
" "I've got a new Ferrari there.
" "Not interested.
" This Even John Humphrys dropped by for a look.
Hammond No Well, can't you just clean them? Really, Â£4,000 to whiten them? 4,000 quid? You've white? No, well, I'll stick with the yellow ones.
OK.
Take care! Bye.
Who's got the car? That's fantastic! Who's stolen the car? God, the power under this bonnet! It's impressive! Ah, Clarkson, you've met your match here with me.
Please don't just steal our things.
D'you mind? Thanks very much.
Jolly nice of you.
Soon, I was summoned to an important BBC meeting.
Most of the people going would be walking, but I was running late, and decided to use the car.
'Doors closing.
' 'Fourth floor.
' Fiona Bruce is standing here, the newsreader.
'Ground floor.
' Sorry, Fiona, could you give me a push? A push out? Please, cos it's got no reverse gear, so Thank you! Shall I leave you right there? This is fine, thanks.
She has got quite a nice bottom.
I said that out loud, didn't I? After a short drive, I arrived at BBC Television Centre.
Unfortunately though, this is the most complicated building in the world.
I've worked at the BBC for 20 years and I still don't know where I'm going.
Tomorrow's World was cancelled, not because the programme wasn't interesting any more, but simply because Judith Hann was lost in here.
Remember John Noakes, Peter Purves from Blue Peter? They're in here somewhere, lost Hello, can anyone help? Thanks! Which department's this? I'm really lost now.
"Talks with Government ministers about how to handle the number of claims that have resulted from last month's floods The total bill is estimated at about Â£1.
5b Mark Simpson is here" Sorry! Sorry, everyone! Sorry! Eventually, though, I made it to the top-level BBC seminar.
I believe we've already made significant inroads into the implementation of an open and inclusive policy for the ethnocentrically homogenous objectives of this department.
But I'd like to say that climate change is the biggest threat EVER to face the peoples of this world.
And minimising our carbon footprint through the functional usage is a key responsibility of anyone who uses a photocopier.
I hope that in this session we can discuss and address Sadly the meeting went on for so long, that there was no time left in the day for any programme-making.
.
.
for the ethnocentrically So I headed home.
I really do think that today I have seen the future.
And it comes from 1963.
This Peel P50 really is absolutely brilliant.
If it had a reverse gear, I would describe it as the absolute ultimate, really, of personal mobility.
That's Dermot Murnaghan! Oi! It is! Murnaghan! Murnaghan! Oh! Thanks! Thanks for that! Sorry We really have a very big problem at the BBC with newsreaders.
Just the other day we were in the canteen, Paxman came through on a Harley Davidson.
They're out of control! Is this the best car we've ever had on Top Gear? Yes! Honestly, I think it's genuinely astonishing! But I think I can now go one better! Because, ladies and gentlemen, I'm able to reveal there is a sports version of this car! Who'd like to see it? Here we go! Look at that! It's just staggering! It's "The Jetsons" I just want one of those.
That is That would be my perfect two-car garage.
Yeah Now, a year ago, Jeremy raced James and me from Italy to London.
James and I in his ridiculous aeroplane, and Jeremy in a Bugatti Veyron.
And, annoyingly, he won.
Then we heard from a bunch of aeroplane enthusiasts called the RAF.
They said, "Why don't you come up to our place and we've got a plane "that'll give your car a run for its money.
" And, well since I'm the only one who hasn't yet driven the Bugatti Veyron, I took up the challenge.
Yes, the 1,000 horsepower legend is back and, if I'm honest, I'm a bit nervous.
Not because of the car itself, but because of the burden that now rests on my shoulders.
When Jeremy drove the Veyron, all he had to beat was an incompetent James in a useless little aeroplane.
Then when James went to Germany and maxed it, the car didn't even break sweat.
But this time, the Veyron's honour really is at stake because never before has it gone up against something like this.
The most modern, the most hi-tech strike fighter on the planet.
The Eurofighter Typhoon.
And for once, when it comes to figures, the Bugatti really is well and truly top-trumped.
Its twin engines develop 20,000lb of thrust each, punching the Eurofighter up to 65,000ft and a top speed of over 1,500mph.
This machine is the cutting edge of what a plane can do.
It's actually designed to be aerodynamically unstable to make it as agile as possible in a dogfight.
So it needs 70 computers to keep it in the air, and if they fail, it would simply fall out of the sky.
It's a kind of a mix of science fiction and brute strength.
These wings, for example, have to be able to take the stresses and strains of all those extreme, high-speed manoeuvres.
They might look slim and dainty, but each one can take the weight of 35 Volkswagen Golfs.
All in all, a handy bit of kit, as you'd expect, at Â£67m a pop.
Faced with the clear and present danger of the Eurofighter, the Bugatti Veyron really is the car world's best shot at clinging to some honour.
And no-one knows what the outcome will be.
In fact, Bugatti's so concerned, they've sent over not one, but two Veyrons.
Maybe they're gonna tie them together or something.
The shoot-out will take place here: on the main runway at RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire.
And here's the challenge: it's a horizontal versus vertical drag race over two miles.
Here's the start-finish line and the car and the plane.
Yeah, It's difficult to get hold of models of a Veyron and a Eurofighter.
Both start from here, the car will race down the runway for a mile, when it reaches the mile marker, turn, as quickly as possible, and then race back down, over the same mile, to cross the start-finish line here.
Meanwhile, the plane will set off, and take off as quickly as possible, and cover a mile vertically.
When it's done the mile, it turns and swoops back down the same mile to cross the start-finish line.
Or to crash into a Â£1m supercar it didn't expect to see and YouTube has a field day.
Otherwise, last one to finish is a vegetarian.
Simple as that.
Now, you might think the plane is going to walk it.
But don't be so sure.
The car should have the edge off the line.
It will do nought to 100 in 5.
7 seconds, for God's sake.
And when it gets to these yellow dots, which mark the mile point where it has to turn around, the Veyron has another advantage.
Down here, its awesome brakes should come into play.
And then there's the air brake as well, which on its own generates the same stopping power as you'd get in a normal hatchback.
A straight line is a straight line.
So the car does what it does there.
But up here, I've got to brake as late as possible, and lose as little time as possible making the turn, before the return mile.
so I reckon it'll be won or lost here at this end.
Traction control off, gearbox to manual, launch control, left foot on brake, give it the full beans on the throttle This is it.
'Stand by one, give me 20 seconds.
' As drag races go, you will agree, this is quite a good one.
We are away! We're neck and neck! I'm getting away! I can't believe I'm looking in Wow!! I can feel the wash from the jet! And there it goes! So I'm fighting for the Germans in a battle against the RAF! If you're watching thinking, "This is cool" It is.
After just 18 seconds I was doing 188mph and getting ready to brake for the mile turn.
That's as late as I dare.
This is where it's won or lost.
I'm on the return mile now.
This is the best race in history! If I mess this up, I may as well get a paper out.
I was doing 196mph but was it enough? I must still be ahead, I can't see the plane.
NO-O-O-O-O!!! Nooo! I suspect I may get some abuse for this.
You failed! You are a vegetarian and you failed and you're useless.
Yes Gotta admit though, it IS quite a car.
Oh, it is staggering, but what a plane! And here is the guy who flew it: Squadron Leader Jim Walls.
Must have been terrifying.
Well, it was, because Not you, him! Had to wake up that morning, "What am I doing today?" "Oh, Richard Hammond's coming, he's driving a fast car in a straight line on a runway in the North!" He's not gonna go, "Can I do nuclear war instead?" So, well done, mate, fantastic.
Next week we are in Africa, for a Top Gear special.
The three of us are trying to drive across the spine of the continent in three ordinary, used, 2WD road cars.
It is worth watching, trust me.
See you then, Good night!

<|endoftext|>

Hello! Hello and welcome! Thank you very much.
Now, as you know, the producers on this show like to give us challenges, specifically where they give us a very small amount of money and tell us to buy a used car then they set unbelievably hard tasks to do to see which one of us got the best deal.
Yeah.
This week for a Top Gear special they came up with a real humdinger.
They gave each of us 1500 quid and told us to go to Africa and buy a car.
Yeah, and there were just two conditions: It mustn't be four-wheel drive and it mustn't be built, in any way, to go off road.
The meeting point was the border post between Zimbabwe and Botswana.
And, for once, I was the first to arrive.
Now, as you'd expect, I've done this properly.
What I've got is a 1985 Mercedes-Benz 230E, a car that Africa absolutely adores because it's comfortable, it's rugged, it's dependable and, frankly, if the other two have brought anything other than one of these along, they're idiots.
The first idiot arrived.
- Can you open the door? The handle's broken.
- It is a Lancia Beta.
Coupé, 1981.
The only Lancia of any sort in the whole of Botswana.
It's done 29,000 miles.
Mm.
One owner, is it? It was a little old lady.
And boy had she ragged it.
Yeah, that's normal, isn't it? That fizzing.
That's er Yeah.
What's the piece of cardboard for? Is that for mopping up moisture? - No that's because the battery - Oh, it shorts on the bonnet.
- Shorts on the bonnet a bit.
- Right.
You've done well.
So now what? Do you want a lift? We left the Lancia to cool down because Hammond was arriving.
- What the hell is that? - I dunno.
Could it be a Moskvitch? Ju Opel! It's an Opel! And on the front it says Kadett.
Yeah! What the hell have you done, man? It's an Opel Kadett from 1963.
- So that's the same age as you.
- Same age as me.
Yes, but it's much better nick than you are.
It was 1200 pounds.
I had much change with which to buy many beads.
How much more simple can you get? It's got two moving parts and it's been here for 44 years.
- I love the speedo.
- I do like a horizontal speedo.
I really do.
- Where's the engine? Hold on.
- It's there.
It's tiny! - Do you wanna know about the power? - Yes, I do.
- 40.
- 40? - 40 horsepower? - Well, they did do a sport version with 48 but I didn't want anything too lairy.
- You've both been idiots.
- No! Brilliantly interesting, brilliantly stylish - but stupid.
- Why's mine stupid? What is yours? Where is yours? Whoa! A Lancia? You have been a bit thick.
With the cars at the start line it was time for our challenge.
"The people of Surrey think they need four-wheel drive cars "because they live up a lane which sometimes has leaves on it.
"You will now attempt to prove them wrong by driving your two-wheel drive cars "from here on Botswana's eastern border with Zimbabwe" Just there.
"1000 miles to its western border with Namibia.
"That's right across the spine of Africa.
" I'm confident.
I wasn't.
We hadn't even started and the Lancia was playing up.
James chose not to wait.
He may be mechanically confident but he has just turned right which is Zimbabwe.
Which is where, I should point out, the BBC is not allowed.
Oh, hello! "Sorry, sorry.
I'm going now.
" The Lancia wheezed into life and Hammond and I set off in pursuit.
If you think of the cars that this inspired.
It was latterly built in Russia where it became the Moskvitch, which was rubbish.
And, of course, indirectly, the Vauxhall Astra.
Quite a lot of reasonably average cars owe themselves to this.
I don't know if you know but Africa is really quite large.
And when you're out in a very remote part you need a car like this, that can be mended with a brick and a piece of string.
What you have to remember is that three of the most rugged and successful rally cars ever made were Lancias - the Stratos, the 037 and the Delta Integrale.
Lancia know how to make a rally car.
Unfortunately, on the day my Beta Coupé was made they obviously forgot everything.
The gear box is broken, the steering's broken, the window's broken.
In fact, we all had problems.
Everything works, except this knob, which controls the blower.
I've got to have the windows open because there's quite a strong smell of petrol.
And that mirror over there which is actually slightly stuck.
Hazard warning lights, the clock, the fan, the handbrake, all of the dials.
The brakes are terrible because they only work on that wheel.
They work very well on that wheel, but only on that wheel.
And that instrument's a bit wobbly.
Apart from that everything that's actually important to the car works perfectly.
Apart from the handbrake, which I can pull like this as we go along.
This is just the happiest car in the world.
I should call it Oliver, not that we'd ever name a car on Top Gear.
I wish I hadn't said that.
It's now five past ten in the morning and it's starting to get quite hot.
I've got an idea.
Oh yeah, that's better.
Don't know what that is.
A horn! Oh, Oliver! You've got a cold.
Listen.
We were having fun but then we discovered we were traveling with Bill 0ddie.
- Why have you got a pen? - You tick them off when you've seen them.
Hornbill, Southern Yellow-billed.
to even look at your car.
It's massive! Don't knock Oliver Don't knock my car.
That's a fine he's a fine - What did you call it then? - Oliver's a friend of mine - He's given it a name.
- He's given his car a name.
So far, the journey had been a doddle.
But then the tarmac just sort of stopped.
Oh, this is bad.
I can see from here just how hard the suspension on Jeremy's Lancia is having to work.
It's just a blur.
Come on, Oliver.
Please! The later you book a lift in the Mercedes, the more expensive it gets.
It's a bit like an airline.
Oh God! Oh! I've broken it.
Engine isn't working.
It's cut out.
Oh dear.
- He's done literally one kilometer of this.
- I know what's wrong with it.
The bonnet won't open.
- It's the bonnet catch, it's - Shut up! Hammond was tetchy because he knew the price of failure.
Anyone who's car broke down would have to complete the journey in a Beetle.
It is collectively our least favorite car in the world.
- Ooh, yes.
- It is the punishment.
Please! Oh! Hang on! Hang on! Ooh! Come on, Oliver! What did you say? I said, "Oli Oli I love ya!" - Oh my God.
- What now? My car's on fire, but in a very specific place.
Wow! Look at that.
It was a magnifying glass? - There's a laser beam coming through it.
- It's like you dropped acid on it.
Oh, his piece of cardboard's gone.
So it sets itself on fire.
If you don't have a piece of cardboard.
We drove deeper and deeper into the bush.
Lancia, yeah! What is that? Looks like the sea.
Eventually the road disappeared altogether.
People of Surrey, I hope you're watching this.
We are driving a Lancia Beta Coupé, well, just in the middle of whatever you call this.
The good news was we'd successfully reached our campsite for the night.
The bad news came in the shape of another challenge.
"Stretching before you is the Makgadikgadi.
"These are the biggest salt flats in the world, "almost completely lifeless and as wide as Portugal.
"No car has ever driven across them.
"If you run out of water you will die.
"If your car breaks down and you can't be rescued you will die.
"If you run out of food you will die.
"It's like driving on a creme brulée.
"There's a primeval ooze covered with a thin layer of salty crust.
"If you have thin tires you will break through that crust, get stuck and you will die.
" So it advises to fit fat tires and remove as much weight as possible before setting off.
- Well, how hard can it be? - Don't say that! In camp, the weight-shedding began.
Ready? That doesn't work.
Thanks awfully.
- Wow, feel how much this seat weighs.
- Like your work.
Ah! Fuel filler, I'll need that maybe.
I don't want to take the hub caps off really cos they protect the hubs.
- Can I point something out? - What? Hammond's walking round his car muttering about how he needs all of it.
I know exactly what he's doing.
He's formed an emotional attachment, hasn't he? It'd be like saying to him, "Could you cut bits off your wife?" The next morning, on the edge of the salt pans, we thought we'd come under attack from a Bond villain.
But it turned out to be the vice president of Botswana.
That is a cool ride.
It is.
It's better than an official Rover 75 and a couple of policemen on motorbikes.
He was amazed to hear what was being planned.
I've just never known anybody to go across in a car.
This'll be the first time, I think.
- There they are.
- Oh, really? - Oh, really? - Yes.
- That should be interesting.
- You were smiling, you've just stopped.
Buoyed by the vice president's optimism, we set off.
Nothing really prepares you for the sheer size of these.
I think, in a way, that it's more frightening than the Pole.
There's absolutely nothing.
You can see the curvature of the earth.
As we ploughed on, the little 0pel was going well.
Oliver is just skipping.
Boo! This car was born to do this.
Sadly, despite the weight-shedding, my Lancia was not doing so well.
Judging by the way the tires are kind of digging in as I'm driving along, I think a little bit more has to come out.
Still, as you can see from the tires' grooves, I was doing better than the Merc.
I'm looking at James' rear wheel and he is digging in a long way.
I tried to help him along.
Really helpful.
Well, there's always the Beetle, James.
It's waiting for you.
What are you gonna do? It's sinking.
- We've done How far's that? A mile? - If that.
My Lancia waded in again.
Just a nudge.
- That's a crash - There's a thing.
Unfortunately, because it was an automatic, it was useless.
So, we told Richard to try.
But he didn't want to hurt 0liver.
This was hopeless, so we had to rope in the camera crew.
Three! Two! One! Hoy! Because the ooze was so bad, we had to get even more drastic with the weight-shedding.
We toiled away for hours.
Da-da! Oh God! Well, two of us did.
And then finally we were ready.
Now, this is light.
Lancia Beta Coupé Superleggera! Not a modification! - This is excellent.
- Why don't all cars have no doors? When I come to power I'm gonna make it a rule, cos this is just better.
However, the Makgadikgadi was not going to let us off that lightly.
And soon even our super-lightweight cars started to struggle again.
Come on, just Oh! Oh, yes.
No, this isn't good.
Oh, no.
which was bad news for me.
Yes! Come on, man! I'll go forwards, Hammond, then we'll do it again.
Hang on.
- How far is it? - Five or six yards and we might be Bobby.
Oh, this is just horrible! Keep going, keep going, keep going! Keep going! Yes! Yes! No! James, don't go there.
You'll get stuck.
That's close.
Come on! Oh, permission to say cock.
- Can we have everybody? We'll push it off.
- We need 100 men or more.
No! This is hopeless.
People of Surrey, you need four-wheel drive for this bit.
The gunk was so sticky it had completely jammed the Lancia's rear wheels.
I can't describe You just think it's just mud Do you know what it is? Fish.
It's just rotted prehistoric fish.
One, two, three.
Mercifully, the ground eventually hardened and we made good progress.
But then suddenly the horizon was no longer flat.
This is interesting.
We're now coming between what look like islands.
And I suppose they are.
This was a lake, so they would have been islands.
Amazing.
Absolutely amazing.
Where are we? It's called Kubu Island.
We're about I'm trying to think.
a third of the way across.
And you've been stuck about a thousand times.
That is smug.
A Baobab tree.
I've always wanted to see one of those.
- Hammond, look at this.
- Whoa! It is just about the most astonishing place I've ever been.
God, I'm with you there.
As the sun set, we headed for the campsite.
Day two on the salt pans, and we'd been told that today our problem would not be mud but dust.
That meant James and I had to rethink our wardrobe solutions.
I've teamed my keffiyeh with a bin liner.
V-necked! The last time I wore one of these I went to see the Clash.
Frankly, I thought it was all a bit much.
I mean, how bad could this dust be? Aargh! My eyes! Crikey, I can't even see Jezza already.
Oh, no, no, no, no! Meanwhile, in my unmodified Kadett I'm gonna adjust my quarter light a bit.
Just an inch.
That's better.
I can feel the hate now.
It's nice.
Me kakai's come off.
Hello? James and I made it through the dust with our lives considerably shortened.
I've got consumption and TB.
I've got every single 1920s disease.
And then Lord Smug piped up.
I had to close this at one point.
About that much, then it pulls the air out and you get fresh air through.
It's nice.
Know what it's like when someone punches you really hard in the face? I do, actually.
Then the surface got even worse.
It was like we were descending through the seven circles of hell.
Oh no! I'd assumed it'd be the salts that would kill the notoriously rust-prone Lancia but it was the rough going.
Even though it had now smoothed out again, the Beta was in a bad way.
- I've gone.
- Are you conkered out? - I've got no power, no drive.
- Do you remember what the man said, Jeremy? Break down and you will What is it? Have a nice time? No, die.
Well that's loose, that's hot.
It is a good job they canted this engine over by 20 degrees cos that means it's more inaccessible than it would otherwise have Oh my God, look at this.
For God's sake.
I gotta say it has been nice, the peace.
You know, not having him around.
I've checked the alternator, the spark plugs, the HT leads and the distributor cap, poked around with the starter solenoid.
There's been faults with all of them, but it still isn't going.
I'm not sure which I favor most here - certain death or that Beetle.
Come off! Oh, for God's sake.
I honestly believe it's had it.
- Is my car on the crab? - No, it's tracking true, mate.
He's worried about tracking and look at it.
We knew that Jeremy would eventually catch us up, but what would he be driving? I can see something in the mirrors.
- Please let it be a Beetle.
- I do hope it's a Beetle.
Please, please let it be a Beetle! Please let it be a Beetle.
I'm back! Oh, Jeremy, well done.
I'm disapp Sorry, delighted.
You're not in a Beetle! Not a Beetle! A fully-functioning Lancia Beta Coupé! I just wanted the Beetle to pounce on you when you were straying behind.
I'm gutted.
- Shall we just sandwich him, James? - No! With our convoy back up to strength, we pressed on.
Apart from Jeremy being Bill 0ddie occasionally.
- This is where flamingos breed out here.
- So that's breeding, is it? - It's a fossil.
- It's not, it only died about two years ago.
- I was talking about you.
- It's an ex-flamingo.
- Look! - What now? I know what created this.
- Ostrich.
- Yes! It's legs are miles apart.
That's exactly how it was walking.
You know David Attenborough's about to retire? Can I just say, you look like a gay cowboy and you look like a gay terrorist.
No, you look like a terrorist with a broken windscreen wiper and your face is ridiculous.
Then Hammond started to pick on my car.
- Why haven't you turned it off? - It's gathering electricity.
So, if you turn it off the battery's not going to start it again.
- Turn it off and start it then.
- Yeah, go on.
Turn it off and start it.
Let's have some beautiful silence.
- Are you ready? - Yes.
- Are you ready? - Yes.
Behold.
- Why did you turn it off? - Because he said it would - Good luck.
Somebody'll give you a jump start.
- It'll be fi Don't go away.
Goodbye! Annoyingly, Clarkson got the Lancia going again, and then we came across some big birds.
Wow! And then we saw even more wildlife.
There's a cow.
Two cows, three cows.
Yes! We've done it! We had crossed the Makgadikgadi.
Trees! Life! Mate, did you ever think that you'd do that? I'm genuinely proud of him.
I am! Really, I'm startled that this It isn't a car any more, whatever it is, has done it, with its low-profile tires and its low suspension that's broken.
Personally, I'm absolutely delighted cos I think the Makgadikgadi is one of the most unpleasant places I've ever been.
It's just a big bowl of dust.
Hello, mate.
Widow Twankey may have been glad to see the back of the salt pans but despite this they gave us a startling parting gift.
That is amazing.
That's the moon? Yeah, that's the moon.
Because of the dust from the pans you get A moonrise.
An orange.
I've got goose bumps.
I know a Philip Larkin poem about the moon.
Would you like to hear it? No.
As a new day dawned our cars looked like wrecks.
But their ordeal was far from over.
Yes, we had crossed the salt pans, but we were still only a third of the way across Botswana.
And now, we were about to enter the Kalahari.
The Kalahari.
Everyone who comes to the Kalahari takes away a different memory of it: The savagery, the simplicity, the vast heat.
Me, I think the bumpiness.
It was as rough as hell, so we were glad when news came through that we were to stop at the next village.
They seem to recognize a truly classy car.
What could they possibly have in mind for us here? It was another challenge.
There you are.
"Your cars have traveled far and suffered much.
" Yes, they have.
"So we will now discover how much performance they've lost "in a competition against the clock on a rally special stage.
" Mine can't have lost any performance, it never had any.
- True.
- I'm not gonna ruin my Mercedes just for a few points.
- You're right, you're not.
You're not driving it.
- Well, who is? Some say he's seen The Lion King 1,780 times and that his second best friend is a cape buffalo.
All we know is he's not The Stig, but he is The Stig's African cousin! Wow! He's protected the important bits.
Keen to get going, the three of us fired up our engines.
And we drove to African Stig's rally stage which was in a dried-up river bed a few miles away.
With packed spectator stands 0liver went first.
Three! Two! One! - Go! - Start! Three miles an hour.
You know when it was new it had 40 horsepower? - If it's lost one a year it's at minus four.
- Minus four, yeah.
He's going round the first corner, hold on.
That was a power slide.
Look at that, it does look "Ridiculous" is the word you're looking for.
As the Kadett struggled to get up the hill, the spectators left.
It is having a Come on, joggle it, Stig's cousin.
He's enjoying that.
- And one minute, 12 seconds.
- Oh yes! That's a good benchmark for you to try and beat.
Next up was the Panzer tank.
- Most powerful, longest, best tires - Heaviest, slowest.
What, longest? - Longest is good for rallying, is it? - It is on this.
So on loose-surface rallies why don't they turn up with intercity trains? Go! That's the most ridiculous spectacle I've ever seen.
A Mercedes with no bonnet, no front wings, no doors.
In the hands of African Stig though, it was flying.
That is the latest in a long line of pedigree-lightened Mercedes-Benz sports cars.
There's never been a Mercedes rally car.
Oh, yours is flying up the hill, mate.
Look at it go.
You wait till you see, the Lancia will dance through there.
Oh yes.
Lovely.
Oh! It's out of control there.
That's a big slide! - One minute, six.
- I'll just do my ancient I hate you gloating.
Let him.
It's like winning a semi final.
Time now to put James in his place because the Lancia was on home turf with its rally pedigree.
Stratos, 037 What? It's not dust, it's on fire! Shut it down.
Can you turn it off? Look at it all! Stopwatch still running.
45 seconds.
We'll replace the seal and then when it's cooled down a bit he'll be able to do the lap.
You'll have difficulty though.
He's off.
Maybe he's started.
Start the stopwatch.
I think he was in a hurry - so he decided not to take your car.
- Jeremy.
- What? - You're right, though.
Your engine, it's canted.
The next day, in the center of Maun, we got our next challenge.
- This is it.
- Ah, the glittering golden envelope.
"You will drive your cars to Namibia through the Okavango Delta.
" That's the really big wildlife place.
"In the Okavango you will encounter many deadly animals "including lions, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, "wild dogs, hippos, black rhino and crocodile, "bird snakes, shield-nose snakes, puff adders, "boomslang, cape cobras, banded cobras, "black mambas, black widows and thick-tailed scorpions.
" - What about the honey badger? - The what? That's the least scary-sounding animal in the world.
A honey badger does not kill you to eat you, it tears off your testicles.
- It does not! - Why's it called a honey badger? - Cos that's what's made it angry.
- Why isn't it called the badger of death? In order to protect ourselves from the lions and the honey badgers, Jeremy and I would have to rebuild our cars.
But because we'd left all the bits on the other side of the salt pans, we had to use whatever we could find.
Could a lion eat this? Grrr! Who do I see about the corrugated metal? Suppose I better practice, at least, my lion drill.
Oh no! There's a lion coming! Ah! What shall I That.
Oliver will protect me.
Because Mercedes were very popular in Africa, James soon found a spare door and boot lid for his car.
And while he was looking for more bits, I hatched a plan.
Look what I've got.
- That's a cow's head.
- Yeah.
Now, this will attract flies which will make his life unpleasant.
- Yes.
- It will also attract lions, tigers He effectively becomes a burger van driving through.
And to make sure the lions didn't miss - Oh, yeah! That's a whopper! - That's a good piece.
Oh, yeah, under the seat.
- And the smell - Oh! The smell will be beautiful.
We also attached a cowbell to the underside of his car.
But while we were doing this, he was making merry with the paint.
That afternoon we left Maun and headed north to the 0kavango Delta.
Right.
My car now has been readied.
As you can see, I have a wooden door here.
It's a gull-wing, so I can get in and out, obviously.
God, this is like being in an allotment shed.
On a very windy day.
On the left I have all the cans that were in the car for the last few days, they've been arranged.
And the piece de résistance Badgers, go away.
I am the road warrior.
Mad Jeremy.
It's a police car.
Can anybody else smell burning or is it my car? Is it like a barbecue smell? As we went through the gates and into the game reserve, the road changed again.
For the worse.
This is new.
Very soft sand.
To stop our cars bogging down we had to drive as fast as possible.
We had ourselves another rally stage.
Amazingly, even Jeremy had his work cut out keeping up with the 0pel.
Hammond's car just looks so composed.
I'm developing this irrational hatred of him and it.
Ho-ho! This is such a good game! Eventually he was slowed down by a bridge over the river Kwai.
The rally stage had taken its toll on one of the cars.
Take a guess which one.
I'm in a car which, as you can probably hear, has got a throttle that's jammed wide open and I can't hold it on the brakes.
Hammond, move! You're gonna have to go fast when I hit you.
What? - Oh, God! - Thanks! Well, help yourself to my brakes! - Why not? - I've lost a skull.
Monkeys.
I'm sorry, I can't Whoa! Just hear the throttle.
That's tick-over.
Look, my leg's not on it.
Having bodged my throttle, we headed deeper into the 0kavango.
Front, twelve o'clock One o'clock.
This is where wildlife cameramen come to make a name for themselves with David Attenborough.
But, unfortunately, our film crew are best really with cars.
A giraffe on the right.
There.
The big thing.
If we ever do a program called The Back End Of An Animal, these are the boys to hire.
This week on Too Late To Look Baboon on the left with animals, with a baby on its back.
To give our crew a chance we stopped, and discovered that we weren't much good at animals either.
- Wow! Look! Look! - Where? - A hippo's head.
- It's probably a whole hippo.
The rest of him's under the water.
What does a hippo do just before it's about to attack? Opens its mouth.
It can open its jaw there's a thing it can do.
Oh, look! Aw! Look at that.
They stop for a drink, using their noses to shovel water into their mouths.
Jeremy, that's a rubbish commentary.
James took over.
That one's lifting its paw up a bit like a dog does.
- Paw! - Hoof, foot, whatever you call it.
- Hoof? - What is it on an elephant? It's amazing.
There's a man over there with the best combover I have ever seen in my life.
That is He's got four partings as a result of that, can you see? Why don't "You're bald, live with it.
" Oops, he caught me looking at him.
- I was looking through binoculars.
- I was looking at the elephants, really, I was.
Look at that sun now, boys.
Elephants, rally special stage, - best combover I've ever seen.
- Everything's here.
We camped by the river and while James serviced his car I hatched a plan.
- Jeremy.
Jeremy.
Jeremy! - What? Quick, come here.
Come here.
It's the cow's head.
It wasn't working in the boot but I've had a better idea.
- What? - Tent.
- His tent? - Yeah.
Love your thinking.
It's the second one from the right.
You find it.
That's it.
Put it under his bed.
- Shh! - What? - What was that? - That was a hippo.
What? Clarkson There's a very big hippo.
Oh my Look at that.
Hippos spend all day in the water and then they come out at night because I can't remember why.
Well, thank you.
That's useful.
What's that? Oh, brilliant! Look, do you wanna go out there with a hippopotamus? Or do you want to stay in here with a horse's head? - That's not a question that's ever been asked.
- It's not a horse either, it's a cow! Erm, hang on.
That's my bag in James' This is my tent! Oh man! Get it out! border felt like it was in another time zone.
But still there were many miles of delta to cover, and our cars were in a really bad way.
The bush mechanic we have on the team took two cubic feet of sand out of my carburetor last night and asked if I wouldn't mind driving a little bit more slowly today.
James' cowbell! getting more and more out of their depth.
This is proper off-roading now.
Men in camouflage trousers in Wales who like murdering people at weekends would say this was tough-going.
It was a whole Oh! - What is it? It's like iron.
- It's a tree root.
I think I've bent my steering rack a bit.
Wow! Wow, there is an elephant right there.
Got my door down.
Cos that would stop an elephant.
Soon our route was blocked by a river and what you're supposed to do is wade in to check the depth.
Right.
James went first and I said I'd watch for crocodiles.
I say, there's a ground-hornbill over there.
It's getting deeper! - Ooh! Hang on a minute! - Permission to say cock.
It's coming in! Thunderbird One to the rescue! Come on, I'm sinking by the bows.
Coming.
- Aargh! No! I can't help you! - Come on! - James, I'm in a low-slung sports car! - I'm going down! - That's good.
Yes! - I've got water coming into my car! Oh, I've got a wet bottom! We're through! Both our cars were flooded but our guides weren't bothered at all.
People of Surrey, if this happens to you, you get water in the foot well and you need to drain it out, you need a hole, well, the people of Botswana have a tip for you.
Meanwhile, using patience, I'd found a proper crossing point.
There is a technique to fording rivers, even on a proper ford like this.
You've gotta keep enough speed up so you push a bow wave like that then you use whatever power you've got in the engine.
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh my! No! Oh God! He stalled! He's going down! I can't open the door! Oh God! Please! Come out! Come on! Float! Float! Float! Oliver! Hammond, how's it going? Well, I got a bit of water in him.
We did as well, but it doesn't matter cos we used the rifles, we shot the cars and the water's all drained out.
It's brilliant.
Good.
I might need the rifle.
As a local tourist truck pulled me out, the laughing hyenas arrived.
May gave his diagnosis.
Starting from the top, the battery's probably pretty knackered - and then the carburetor will be flooded.
- Mm, very.
Then working down, the distributor cap, that'll be full of water.
The engine itself, if water went into the cylinders you might have compressed it.
- The oil will be ruined - I know all this.
I can fix him.
- You are going to try and mend this? - If you'd leave me to it, yeah.
So we did.
Oh, that's harsh.
That is quite harsh but go on.
Oh, you'll like this one.
# It's sad # So sad # It's a sad, sad situation Unfortunately, you can only give a man so much sympathy, so James and I went ahead to make camp.
Hammond knew that in the morning, if his beloved 0liver wasn't fixed, he'd have to leave him behind.
So he got our bush mechanic to bring the generator down and worked on through the night.
Morning came, and still no Hammond.
I'm knackered today.
I mean, I'm feeling quite like an explorer.
- That Hammond? - Is it a Beetle, more to the point? No way.
No way.
Oh yeah! Yeah, he's back.
Ah! And here's the best thing.
Remember the horn which was rubbish? It's excellent.
Is that technically possible? Probably not.
With all the cars defying all the odds, we began our final push to the border.
My car is working perfectly, as usual.
I've got no brakes, the pedal goes straight to the floor and I have to declutch to stop so I just tread on my own foot, so I'm using the handbrake.
Hal The Lancia could beat that.
Every time I brake it spears off to the right and I'm unable to steer left to correct that.
This has now gone from being a nuisance to being downright dangerous.
We soon reached the end of the 0kavango, so we pulled over to remove the animal protection.
And then, guess what? The Lancia simply would not get going again.
It now won't start because the starter solenoid's chosen this moment to pack up, but when it was running it wouldn't move off in any of the gears.
It was just that last 60K, it had that feel of a car that was dying.
Richard actually sympathized because he'd been there.
As for James? Beetle! I'm not gonna give up.
I'll push it.
Is this a good time to acknowledge that mine is the only one - that has worked consistently? - No.
This is worrying.
I need to be home by Saturday.
I've been invited to a Beetle drive.
The entire crew was working on the stricken Beta.
Until we were rewarded with the most glorious sound in the world.
Life.
It lives! It lives! I got a whole hundred yards.
Oh, not stuck! My idle speed's not good.
Bye, everybody! I can't stop! Please! Please! Soon, we hit the tarmac and we started to taste the hope.
Just 20 miles, you can do that, you've crossed Botswana.
Now I'm stuck in second but second will do.
Obviously, mine would keep going to the other side of the whole continent but, you know.
Come on, ten miles, please! Then something really surprising happened.
Oh no, not now.
Please! Because the Lancia had been such a problem child everyone was fed up with it.
Carburetor's gone.
Even if we can get that fixed, the starter motor is gone.
We've put it into gear, it goes into third.
That stalls the engine and you're back to square one.
The border was just five miles away.
This is an object lesson for the owners of old cars everywhere.
- You can drive 'em round the world.
- Yeah, it's really relaxing.
Come on.
Border! a thousand miles, I've still got half a car left and very bad hair.
I don't believe that.
Sorry! I've got no brakes.
I've Yeah.
It's there.
We've done it! All we had to do now was wait.
Wait to see which car Jeremy arrived in.
- Is that an engine? - That's a car.
Unmistakable clatter of an air-cooled engine.
It's gonna be the Beetle.
And it was.
But I wasn't driving it.
- I'm almost pleased! - Yes! Oh, that's excellent.
Watch it! Brakes don't work! Sorry, there's no brakes.
Congratulations.
That's astonishing! I think, realistically, we have to say the Lancia's won it.
- Why? By what possible measure? - Erm No.
- It's the most surprising.
- It's the worst.
Well, you don't buy a second-hand car to be surprised that it still works.
- It had to be rebuilt once a day.
- But You're right.
It's rubbish.
- Mercedes is the best car.
- What? - What have I had to do? I've had to - Take the entire body off! It's a showroom model, James.
I admit that it's not entirely original but in mechanical terms it was perfect.
You cannot break that I think, honestly, we have to be magnanimous here because only one of the cars has actually made it unmodified.
So that brings us on to a Top Gear top tip.
If you want to replace your BMW X5 with something that's brilliant off-road - Simple.
simple, inexpensive.
- Easy to maintain, surprisingly comfortable.
- Absolutely.
Then you've got to get yourself a Volkswagen Beetle.
- What? - It's true.
He's right.
You've replaced all the electrics in that



Tonight, The Stig tests a Tube train, Richard tests a pair of shorts and I try my hand at running.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello and welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome to an award-winning Top Gear.
Yeah.
We've got a gong for the best factual program, which is astonishing when you think we haven't actually put a fact in the show for the last five years.
No matter.
We're kicking off tonight with Richard Hammond - not in shorts.
He is, in fact, in an Aston Martin.
This is it, the new V8 Vantage Roadster.
And it's pig-ugly.
Actually, though, it's not, is it? It's unbelievably gorgeous.
Not only is it a looker, it's also got the same 4.
3 liter, 380 horsepower V8 as you get in the Vantage Coupé, which means it makes the same noise.
Oh! That alone is worth 90,000 of the 91-grand asking price.
But let's not get carried away.
Because when Aston hack the top off a car, they're perfectly capable of turning a good sports car into a soggy blancmange.
The DB9, for instance, is fabulous to drive as a hard-top, but much less than fabulous as a roadster.
The question is, have they made the same mistake here? Not exactly.
Usually when they make a cabrio version, they have to soften it up because it can't handle all that sporty treatment.
But the chassis on this roadster is so stiff, they can actually give it firmer suspension.
Result? It actually likes going round corners.
Yes! So, a roadster that drives like a hard-top.
And though it pains me to say it, this thing makes a 911 look like a bit of a minger.
There are, however, a few reminders that although Aston is now privately owned, this car came from the Ford era.
And that it was indeed conceived by Ford's crack team of accountants.
The key fob might have a nice, classy, leather back, but actually it's taken straight from a 20-grand Volvo.
And this screen here for all the computer functions looks like it came off an Amstrad in 1985.
And why, when they got someone to record the voice commands, did they choose the warder from a women's prison? Turn right.
But I'm nitpicking because, really, this is a great car.
Top speed is 175 mph.
Naught to 60 takes 4.
9 seconds.
Often at this point we like to demonstrate a car's straight-line performance by having a drag race.
Today is no exception.
But we thought rather than a drag race against another car, we'd have one against a man.
He's called Dirk Auer and he's from Germany.
Now, if he's going to race me, I'd be stupid to let him hang on to my coat-tails.
And Dirk agrees.
Which is why he's got three jet engines, together making 300 horsepower, that he's going to strap to his back.
Kitted out with an aerodynamic helmet and special inline skates, this human cruise missile claims he can hit 120 mph.
Time to find out if that's just hot air.
Aston Martin say this car will do a quarter-mile in just over 13 seconds.
He didn't even flinch when I told him that.
So let's see what happens when Britain and Germany, in quite an odd way, I must admit, go to battle once again.
If you told people you'd had a dream in which you'd drag-raced an Aston Martin against a man on jet-powered roller skates, people would tell you to lay off the strong cheese at night.
We're away! I can't believe how quickly that thing gets off the line! We're level-pegging! He's on roller skates! Come on! Yeah! I won! I beat a man on roller skates! In an Aston Martin! Yes! Right, it's now time to move on and for me to drive a car.
It's called the Caparo T1 and it's possibly the most amazing, maybe the fastest, and almost certainly the scariest car ever made.
Remarkable-looking thing, isn't it? And even more remarkable when you notice that it has lights and indicators.
And space for a passenger.
What you're looking at here, then, is the first realistic attempt to make a Formula-0ne-style car that you can use on the road.
It hasn't had a particularly easy birth.
At the press launch, a Dutch journalist was in it when some aspect of the front suspension came adrift and it speared off into the undergrowth.
Then, at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, the throttle jammed wide open.
And that happened again when Fifth Gear were testing it.
And then, at 150 mph, it caught fire massively, burning the driver, Jason Plato, quite badly on the hand, the neck and the face.
And now it's my turn.
Because of this car's violent history and the immense speeds it can achieve, the BBC has insisted we beef up our safety precautions.
This is what we normally use - a van with some sticking plasters and aspirin in it.
Today, though, we have enough to deal with a medium-sized plane crash.
Caparo themselves say I'm not allowed to drive it unless I wear a full-face crash helmet and one of these Nomex romper suits, presumably so that if something goes wrong all my organs will be held together in one sort of big, fireproof bag make me easier to collect.
So, everything is in place.
I'm in.
So, first of all, we have to put the steering wheel on.
Goes on the other way up.
That's what it does.
Seat belts.
Right.
On.
The fire-extinguisher system master switch on.
Ignition.
It's a road car so it'll probably be quite quiet.
Here we go.
No, no, it isn't quiet.
If this all goes wrong, er, I'll do the Team America secret signal.
OK.
Horn works.
Here we go.
Well, I don't know what the fuss is all about.
This is very safe.
I can see no danger here at all.
Designed by the same people who brought you the McLaren F1, the Caparo has a 3.
5 liter V8 race engine which delivers 575 horsepower.
That is a huge amount in a car that weighs about the same as a patio heater.
As a result, it has twice as much brake horsepower per tonne as a Bugatti Veyron.
Twice as much.
In a road car, that is a truly terrifying prospect.
So far, though, all four wheels are still on.
Yeah.
The throttle has not jammed open and there is no fire.
So er goodbye, safety people.
Oh, my God! God Almighty! You can forget Enzos, you can forget Koenigseggs.
This is in a different league.
It does naught to 60 in 2.
5 seconds.
Naught to 100 in five and it'll still be going like a bee out of hell all the way up to 205 where, hopefully, the twin tail-planes, like you get on an SR71 Blackbird spy-plane, will keep it stable.
And the braking! Oh, God! You couldn't stop more quickly if you ran into a tree.
Here we go again!! To experience anything like this you would have to be in a Formula 3000 car.
This is acceleration like I have never, ever experienced.
And then the floor came off.
I'm gonna do the secret signal.
Thankfully, it wasn't a big job and soon the T1 was back.
And then there was a problem with the fuel.
Wasn't turning out to be very reliable, this.
And then there's the price.
I don't really know how to soften the blow on this so I'll come straight out with it.
It's L235,000.
Really, then, the only people fit, brave and rich enough to buy such a car are Premiership footballers.
I'm sure Mr.
Rooney will like the speed and the looks very much.
But he's in for a nasty surprise when he gets it back from the menders because this is about as good at taking corners as he is.
Oh, no, that is a lot of understeer.
Oh, that is a lot of understeer there.
Got my foot on the power but there's so much power in this I'm just gonna spin out.
Oh, God, this is a disaster! The shape has been designed so the air flowing over it will press the car into the road.
It'll actually generate 3g in a fast bend.
Unfortunately, in a slow bend the air isn't moving over the body quickly enough and you have almost no grip at all.
Look at it snaking, fighting for grip that just isn't there.
If the tires are cold the problem is ten times worse.
And if the road is wet it'll spin up the rears through third and fourth.
If you try to go round a normal roundabout at a normal speed in this, you're gonna have a huge accident.
When this thing goes on sale, there isn't gonna be a ditch in the land, or a hedgerow, that isn't full of Premiership footballers all broken and on fire.
Because of this car, I wouldn't be at all surprised if Grimsby Town won this year's FA Cup.
And you haven't got room to move in it.
You know, you're sort of But let me just Hang on.
To generate enough downforce to get round a corner, you have to go really fast? Yes.
Brilliant excuse for the police.
"I had to go round that corner, Officer, at 1,000 mph, "cos if I was doing 30 I would have crashed.
" But don't you think The thing I like about this is that it's amazing that this is allowed.
Because, I mean, there's a regulation that says that headlight has to be that height, they have to put the seat belts in, but there are no laws governing how fast it can go.
No, and we must now find out how fast it goes round our track.
Which means, of course, we have to hand it over to someone who understands downforce.
Some say that to unlock him you have to run your finger down his face.
Like that.
And that if he were getting divorced from Paul McCartney he'd keep his stupid, whining mouth shut.
All we know is he's called The Stig.
And he's offl And he's gone already.
Little bit of wheel spin there.
Now he's heading down to the first corner fairly fast.
There should be just about enough downforce to get him round.
Look at the speed he's going in therel Tail kicked out a little bit.
It's snaking.
Now he's got to build up the speed again.
so no self-help.
As he turns into Chicago, running a bit wide.
The understeer kicking in.
Not much he can do about that.
Now he's just back on that 3.
5 liter engine, into the Hammerhead, turning, and he's gonna be in serious bother here if he's not careful.
Understeer again, then oversteer, then understeer, then oversteer.
Now he can get back on the power.
This will be phenomenal through the Follow-through.
Getting on for Formula 0ne levels of grip.
Through the tires.
God, that's quickl Now he's got more bother again cos he's got to go slowly for the second-to-last corner, turning in.
Held that one very nicely.
Last corner.
Again running widel And across the linel Now This is er Despite the handling issues, shall we say, we are expecting this to be pretty fast, mixing it up here with top crowd, the 1.
18s, the 1.
17 s, the 1.
19s.
It actually did it in one minute Staggering.
Absolutely staggering.
That's the fastest thing by miles.
And now what I'm gonna do is take it off again.
- What? Why? - You know the rules, James.
If a car can't get over a sleeping policeman it can't go on that board.
We've always said that, and look at the nose on this.
Never mind a sleeping policeman, you'd rip that off if you ran over Gandhi.
So, er, sorry about that.
And now we're moving on because it's time to put a star in our reasonably priced car.
Now, my guest tonight is a very busy man.
So busy, in fact, that the only hole we could find in his diary was two weeks ago.
So we interviewed him then, and then we thought we'd slide it into tonight's program and nobody would be any the wiser.
I've had my hair cut to match, I'm wearing roughly the same clothes, we're in the same building.
It was all very ambitious but, as is so often the way with Top Gear, I'm afraid it hasn't quite worked because if you watch very carefully, this poppy is about to magically disappear.
Ladies and gentlemen, from the past Simon Cowell! - Welcome back.
- How are you? - Welcome back.
How are you? - Very good, thank you.
Have a seat.
Not your first visit, of course, is it? I was here was it four years ago? Four years ago, when we had the Suzuki Liana.
- We've moved on now.
- Oh, you've really moved up in the world.
Absolutely.
And so have you.
Because then it was Pop Idol, wasn't it? Yeah, second Pop Idol or something.
Since then you've done American Inventor, British Inventor - American Idol, X Factor - American Idol, X Factor.
How many more opportunities are there for you to get a lot of money from phone lines where people vote on things? We only do the phone lines so that the audience can vote.
So we're sort of giving something back to the audience.
- You could do an illegal immigrant one.
- A what? Where people compete for a British passport.
Are you seriously pitching me this idea? No, I'm thinking I might do it, actually.
It's such a good idea.
It's fantastic.
It's yours.
- I just have ideas all the time.
- OK, well, they're not very good.
What, and X Factor is? Yeah.
Yes.
- Why are they clapping? - Well - Now, come on, fair's f - This is your audience, isn't it? You can really tell that.
- Could I be a judge on X Factor? - Shall I tell you why you couldn't? Why? Because I am ageing quite well and you're not.
And I thought about you the other day.
I was reading one of your reviews about a Jaguar, about how Jaguars have to update themselves over the years.
And you are the equivalent of a Jaguar who needs help.
In other words, you know how you do a face-lift on the new Jag whatever it was? - Oh, I can't do a face-lift.
- No, you do.
You need Botox.
You need a face-lift.
Just have half an eye done or something.
I look in a mirror Don't you look in a mirror and just go, - "I'm falling to pieces and I don't care"? - No, I don't think that.
- You care? - I think I look good.
- You do look good but - I know I do.
And we're the same age.
- And I don't care.
- You must do.
- Should I care? Should I care about it? - No.
And that's why you couldn't come on my show.
And the other reason is I'd just sit, going, "No.
No.
No.
" The second reason is you'd be funnier than me.
That's why you'll never come on.
How's America? Is it going well? I like it there.
I've been there five years.
It's fun.
- And you live there.
- I live there for half the year now.
So you've got to split your cars.
America and the UK.
- Yes.
- Come on, then, what have you bought? In England I have an Audi, the new Audi.
The R8? That is brilliant, isn't it? Well, it's very interesting.
I was driving the car the other day and I was thinking about what you said on the show about it being better than a Porsche.
And I was kind of thinking, "Why is it better than a Porsche?" Well, I think the reason it's better than a Porsche - is that people like you in it.
- Mm-hm.
I promise you, at that split second someone overtook me, put their hand out the window and went, "Tosser.
" At exactly that moment.
- Telling you to put your seat belt on.
- Is that what it was? Erm, no, but it's a good car.
And then, on your recommendation, I bought a Lamborghini Gallardo or whatever you call it.
- Spyder.
- Spyder.
Erm which is completely pointless because And I'll tell you why.
When you're driving it around the track here it's fantastic.
- Drive it in London, it's impossible.
- Why? You can't do more than 10 mph in this car.
It's like Naomi Campbell phoning you up, going out for dinner, ending up in a hotel room and she then is telling you that she's a lesbian.
It's sort of pointless.
- I wouldn't mind that.
- "Bring a friend, let's be having a look.
" - You've got a point, actually.
- Er, it's kind of pointless, you know.
You - Why? Because you can't drive these things properly.
But what can you drive in London - that you derive enjoyment from? - That's my point.
Nothing.
- But you've still got the Rolls-Royces? - Yes.
One there, one here? Thanks to Fifth Gear, who recommended it.
Ooh I like Westlife.
- It's one of Louis', isn't it? - No, one of mine, actually, Jeremy.
Is it? Well, they're ! - Aren't they the Irish ones? I get muddled.
- He manages them.
- Oh, OK.
- And they're signed to my record label.
- Who isn't signed to your record label? - Spice Girls.
I like them.
- I wanna hear about my lap.
- Really? - Oh, all right.
Are you a competitive man? - Yes.
- Cos the last time you came here - I won.
you went to the top.
- Absolutely.
And then you were knocked off by Jimmy Carr, wasn't it? Who I saw, like weeks after, who was horribly patronizing about the whole thing.
So today is the day you've come back to see if you can get to the top - Yes.
of the board.
- That's why I'm here.
- How did it go? I don't think it went as well as last time.
- Who'd like to see it? - Yeah.
Play the tape.
OK, here we go.
- What do you think of the car? - Terrible.
It's seriously the worst car I've ever driven.
That's good and aggressive through there.
Prat.
Quite a lot of wheel spin through there.
Then into the Hammerhead.
Nicely done so far.
That's pretty good.
- Is that good? - Yeah, very good.
Right, now, flat from now on.
- Flat? - Yeah.
- And still flat through the tires? - That's how you do it, Jeremy.
I know.
I drive round here all the time.
I've still never timed myself.
Look at this.
Casual.
Relaxed.
Coming up to the second-to-last corner.
Whoo! Into Gambon now and here we go.
And across the line.
Not bad.
Well, there it is.
Where do you reckon? As long as I'm higher than Hugh Grant.
Hugh Grant, 1.
47.
7.
Yeah, no, you're faster than that.
- Well, just tell me.
- No, no.
Do you think you beat Gordon Ramsay, who was seriously quick? - What did he do? - He did 1.
46.
3.
Close.
- You reckon close? - Yeah.
You were, actually.
Very close.
Because you did it in one minute forty You're there.
You're there.
Been waiting for the day.
That is That's fantastic! And Gordon Ramsay has just committed suicide.
Well, to be fair to Gordon Ramsay, he's fat.
So that's worth at least two seconds.
- I That is amazing.
- No, that was, actually.
You really do have a knack for it.
The Stig said you have definitely got a knack.
The cameramen said they'd never seen consistency like it in the practice laps.
Well, the thing is that you should never listen to what you're being told because it's like trying to ride a bicycle.
If someone tells you how to do it, you start thinking about too many things.
You've just gotta get yourself round.
But I'm genuinely thrilled.
- I'm glad I came.
- I'm very glad you came.
Cos I was getting bored with having a Scot not only in Number Ten but also at the top of our Leader Board.
Ladies and gentlemen, Simon Cowell! - I'm so happy, Jeremy.
- Well done.
Wow! What a night.
The records are just tumbling.
First the Caparo blitzes the Koenigsegg round the track, now we've got a new fastest lap.
It's Yeah.
Hello.
My poppy's grown back.
It's a miracle.
- You are such a clot.
- I am.
And now it is time for one of our epic races.
You know the sort of thing - where a Bugatti races across the Alps against a truffle or a McLaren Mercedes races a powerboat to Oslo.
Oh, yes.
And this one isn't that big, to be honest.
But it is more relevant because it's a race to find out what is the quickest way to cross a busy city.
Car, bicycle, public transport, whatever.
We've chosen London.
Now, we start from here, Kew Bridge, the most westerly point of the North Circular.
Which, if you live in Nepal or Coventry, is a sort of ring-road around London.
We then finish up over here at London City Airport, which is at the most easterly point of the North Circular.
So that is a race right across the center of one of the most congested cities in the world.
Now, to make sure that we aren't accused of bias toward the car, it will be driven by the slowest man in the world.
A man with no known sense of direction.
Him.
To make it even less fair, the car they've given me is not a Smart car or my Fiat Panda or anything sensible like that.
It's this.
The new Mercedes GL.
It's 17 feet long, it's about six-and-a-half feet wide.
It weighs 2.
5 tonnes.
It is the Chelsea-est of all the Chelsea tractors.
And I shall attempt to beat him on this.
It's a Specialized Sirrus Limited - a carbon fiber, super-lightweight bicycle.
It's built on a five-piece, monocoque construction with a Body Geometry saddle.
It's got carbon fiber crank set, carbon fiber handlebars, carbon fiber brake levers and it's even got its own unique gel-based suspension system so it can cope with the bumps of London.
- It's L1,700.
- It is quite expensive, yes.
Anyway, this isn't just a race between a car and a bike cos we need to see how public transport will fare.
So we need a third person.
Someone who's never been on a train or a bus, who doesn't know the misery.
Thankfully, on Top Gear we have just such a person.
Now, as we race across London in the car and on the bike, he will catch a bus around the corner.
There he will get an underground train to Monument station and from there he will get on the Docklands Light Railway, which takes him all the way to the airport.
- Are we ready? - Yes.
Ready? - Let's go.
- Hang on.
Hang on.
There is a fourth way.
Oh, God.
- Don't tell me.
A jetpack.
- No.
- Harrier jump jet.
- No.
- A plasma-powered horse.
- No.
I've got a boat.
- How will you get a boat up Knightsbridge? - I'm not.
The River Thames is just behind those houses.
It goes all the way to the airport.
- Like a big blue motorway.
- So you are going to row up the Thames, doing one mile an hour.
Course I'm not going to row.
It's got an engine.
All we know is this, Hammond - it's eight-thirty two - Yes.
on a Monday morning.
- Yeah.
- Peak rush hour.
- I'd call the weather today close.
- Humid.
- Sweaty.
- Yes.
So, genuinely, we have no idea who's going to win this.
- I am.
- You're not.
- I know full well I am.
- You're not.
Are we ready? We're gonna find out.
Three, two - Hold on, he's jumped the gun! - Go now! I'm going.
No rush.
I'm gonna cream it.
See you, Hammond.
That's the last time you're in the lead.
What I've got is a gentle walk to the river, on the boat through the city.
It's a lovely day.
See you, May.
Hammond shot past the traffic on Kew Bridge.
I honestly think I can win this one.
Captain Slow was also full of hope.
This is a car.
This is a car program.
I know you want the car to win.
I want the car to win.
I shall not let you down.
I have a rough idea where I'm going.
I know the river's on my right.
Is it on the I? No, it's on the right.
Sadly, though, both of them were going to be disappointed.
Let's go! OK, what I've got here is a L52,000 Cougar sport racing boat.
It's got a 3.
5 liter VTEC Honda engine on the back, top speed 75 mph.
Unfortunately, on this part of the river - sort of Chiswick - there are many herons and otters, so I'm limited to erm, nine miles an hour.
Ish.
The speed limit is in force all the way to Wandsworth Bridge.
But from there the Thames has no speed limit at all.
- Bye! - Good luck on the bus! Bye! Meanwhile, The Stig saw a huge, red car approaching and he got on it, using something called an 0yster card, which is useful if you have no understanding of money.
I'm in a bus lane, which is good.
I can use them.
However, the other thing that uses them - buses.
The Monday morning rush hour was slowing James.
But I couldn't open up the big lead I'd hoped for for one simple reason.
I've got to wait at the lights.
I'm on telly.
Obviously, I always wait at the lights.
Hello.
Oh! With the car pottering along nicely, I decided to see if Hammond was as comfortable as me.
Hammond? Hammond? Now here's one of the big problems that you have on the river, which is the rowers, who reserve a special kind of hatred for people with engines on their boats.
They are the cyclists of the waterway, the Hammonds.
D'you want a lift? See? She hates me.
Change, change, change.
I'm bloody cycling.
You can go faster cos you've got bandy legs.
I can't go faster.
I haven't got bandy legs.
It was time for The Stig to get out of the big, red car.
Please keep your belongings with you at all times.
Since I was stuck at nine and almost certainly last, I decided to revive the ancient art of using a telephone while driving.
- May.
- Hello, Captain Clarkson.
- Where are you? - Hammers Er, Ha - Yeah.
Hammersmith.
Broadway.
- You No way.
- Where's Hammond? - I don't know.
I tried to ring him but it sounded like his face was rubbing along the road, so he may have had it already.
You realize, James, I have to beat you but I want you to win with that car.
Don't get lost.
To make sure I didn't get lost I was using the Satnav.
- Keep left.
- I know.
- Now keep right.
- Yes, I know.
I know to I'm keeping right.
I knew that.
I was already keeping right.
Please keep left in 100 yards.
Exactly.
You go down there towards My phone's going.
Hello? Hammond.
How's it going, mate? Oh, no! No! Oh, that was the sound of a skull under a bus's Pirelli.
Right.
Time to ring The Stig.
See how he's getting on.
We'd given him a phone but er After 25 minutes this is how things stood.
Hammond was alive and in the lead.
May was breathing down his neck in second.
The Stig was third and I was going in the wrong direction on one of the river's endless and annoying meanders.
I have to make every mile-an-hour count because my average speed is so low.
Don't pull out, don't pull out, don't pull out! I hate buses.
They're stinking, horrible things.
Go.
Bit of Christian motoring there.
That man wanted to pull out.
Let him pull out.
What comes around goes around.
He who is last shall be first.
Oi! Chuffing, bus-driving, bullying Nazi.
Why don't you just wait, and give your passengers a better ride? The next station is Stamford Brook.
The Stig, now in an underground car, had noticed that everyone was doing the same thing.
This has to be the most stress-free and relaxing Monday morning rush-hour commute since the dawn of civilization.
Oh, not another set of sodding lights! Oh, bloody hell! Have a nice walk.
Enjoy yourself.
I knew May was getting stuck at the lights, too, but getting up to speed again didn't wear him out.
Not that he could ever get up to any sort of speed in the first place.
Now, I would never try to ban people from having cars like this - because that would be like communism, really - but I really don't understand why anybody would have something like this for driving around town because it's so big and unnecessary.
It's more than six feet wide.
It's almost six and a half feet wide and that's what makes a difference.
That door is half the width of that whole scooter.
Meanwhile, The Stig was plainly bemused by his strange new world.
No! No! You filthy, foul, stinking Hammond? Agh! You stinking, evil ! Foul, reeking, hell-making piece of Hammond stopped swearing long enough to answer the phone.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Yes? What? I'm just coming up to the Albert Hall.
I wondered how you were doing.
You're just behind me.
I'm stuck at the lights again.
Ooh, right.
Well, I'll give you a friendly peep as I go past.
I'll kick the crap out of your car if you do.
and Richard was still in the lead.
James was still on his tail.
The Stig was still in a tunnel and I was still following a path forged by nature, at nine.
But I wasn't worried at all.
Hammond, by now, will just be bathed in sweat.
Hideous, smelly.
People will vomit when they go near him.
James, of course, he'll end up in Huddersfield, perhaps.
Pontefract.
Who knows? Not the City Airport.
Er Stig, don't know.
Might think he's a Brazilian electrician.
And then me, having a lovely time and I'm going to win.
I was now scything down Piccadilly.
And joy of joys, the traffic was horrible.
As it turned out, jams were the least of my problems.
Oh, crikey, it's the rozzers.
The police only wanted to check the permit for our camera car, but it still cost me valuable time.
So, on on the basis that stopping here I've lost about three or four minutes in the race, and that sort of corrupts the result, can we just do four minutes of blues-and-twos and I'll follow you? What I can do is I can give you a 5090 to say that I've stopped you and then you can submit that to your superiors - as a record of me stopping you.
- What? I was pulling further ahead.
Trafalgar Square, left.
Right, this is where I need to be.
Cycle lane.
One, two, three meters of it and then I'm back under that bus.
With Plod off my back, I now had to pay Ken Livingstone for permission to sit in his jams.
Er I'm sorry, that was an incorrect selection.
Hello.
I need to pay the congestion charge for London.
your vehicle number, please? Er I don't know.
Erm Er Fifty six, Hotel Foxtrot Zulu.
Is that a Mercedes GL500 in silver? How did you know that? It's actually a 5.
5 liter but they call it a 500 cos they're a bit embarrassed about it.
With James stuck in the traffic around Piccadilly and Trafalgar Square, I had to seize the moment and push.
There's the river.
That's 24 mph showing.
I've got to keep that up.
Head down, I've gotta just go.
- Hammond.
- Hello.
- Where are you? - I've just got onto Embankment.
- Where are you? - Just going past Fulham Football Club.
This was bad news.
Jeremy was now only a minute or so from Wandsworth Bridge, where he could put his foot down.
So, although the car was imprisoned by the traffic, the boat was coming into play.
And Stig was closing in, too.
Please mind the gap between the train and the platform.
I've got 19 mph showing on my little speedo here.
I've got to keep that up.
I feel sick.
Here we go, Wandsworth Bridge.
Yes! OK, Hammond and May, live with this! That's the Embankment.
Where's May? At this point, Richard was just eight miles from the airport.
I had 17 miles to cover but I was going an awful lot faster.
The Stig was now catching Hammond, too, and even worse news for the one in shorts, James had cleared the traffic.
Here we go.
I've got to beat Jeremy and cannot be beaten by James.
Battersea Power Station, ladies and gentlemen, to your right.
Coming up to Millbank now, headquarters of the Labour Party.
They won't like this very much.
Ha-ha! I don't like this car.
I have to be brutally honest.
It's not my kind of thing.
But a car is, nevertheless, the right way to do this.
I've got it just set to 20 degrees.
Bit of Radio 3.
Yeah, pull out on me, why not? That's what I'm there for! The Stig, in a close second, was now making his final train change.
Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your belongings with you at all times and report any unattended items or suspicious behavior to a member of staff or a police officer.
Hello, Officers.
I just went past the police at 45 mph.
Annoyingly, I couldn't fully open the taps because, weirdly, I had traffic problems.
Look at it.
Just endless tourists.
Come on! Got to get my speed up.
This train directly to King George V via London City Airport.
This is so frustrating.
Aargh! Where is Jeremy on his boat? Where, where, where? Tower Bridge! Coming through! As the river widened I became the fastest-moving man in all of London.
We're knocking on now.
Coming up to 50 mph.
How can we lose now? It simply is not possible.
At this stage, James was last and The Stig was still several stops away from the airport, so it was becoming a two-horse race.
The bends in the river had made my journey seven miles longer but I was now doing a whopping 70 mph.
Hammond was probably feeling quite good about his chances.
Well, I'm sorry, mate, they're gone now.
They're gone.
Bloody lights! Bloody lights! hate them.
London VTS, London VTS, this is Red Cougar requesting permission to go through the barrier at speed.
Schedule copied.
Proceed in through the barrier.
Take Charlie span in-between the green arrows.
Sorry! Somewhere round here there's an airport and I've got to go and park at it.
City Airport.
There it is! Come on! Come on! Come on.
I'm here.
I've arrived! Coming through.
Unfortunately, a gentleman on a bike has checked in already.
- What? - A gentleman on a bike has checked in already.
- Hammond? - Yes.
I mean, too hard on you.
- How the hell did you do that? - It's easier on a pushbike.
- You don't get stuck in queues.
- You've ruined Top Gear.
- Well - It's the last-ever show.
I've bent it a bit.
But hang on.
What you're saying is I've ruined Top Gear - because I won on a bicycle.
- Yes.
You came second in a boat.
Between us we've ruined We've ruined Top Gear.
We sat down to see if Top Gear could be salvaged.
Just so long as the car beats public transport.
What if the car? Oh, God.
That's a very good point.
What if the car loses to public? We need for public transport to come stone-dead last.
We soon got an answer.
- Oh, no! - Did you go on a Tube? Underground? Did it go dark? Flashing lights? - Did you go on a train? - Were there other people? Eugh.
What he's just done is he's gone slower than a boat and a bicycle.
- That'll just be going"Zz zz zz zz.
" - Inside, there's all numbers.
There'll be a bit of smoke come out the top in a minute.
Keep watching.
James arrived.
- Thank you, James.
- What have you done? - The car, as an entity - Ruined.
lies smashed and broken in front of us because of you.
He beat you on public transport.
We're ruined.
I, er Can I clear something up that's just confusing me here? Because you lost, what, about four minutes with that policeman business.
But watching the film, you get the impression that the car arrived Now, if I remember rightly, when I got there, James, you were already there - and had been for ages.
- He was.
And d'you know something else, as well? I distinctly remember my boat blew up - and I was killed.
- Yes.
Yes.
You don't get that sense, watching the film.
- Doesn't come through.
- I'm glad you've said that.
I'm sure I remember cruising straight past Hammond - with his head stuck in some railings.
- That happened.
That did happen.
And actually, d'you know what? London doesn't have a river, so I couldn't have used a boat.
So there we are.
What Top Gear - which is a trusted, award-winning factual program - has proved is that, despite what you've just seen in that stupid and misleading film, - the car was the fastest.
- Yes! - And the best.
- Yes.
And as a result of that, we will be back with more facts.
See you then.
Good night!

<|endoftext|>

Tonight, James races a man in wellies, Richard crashes some motorhomes, and I close down Manchester airport.
Thank you very much, thank you.
Hello.
Hello and welcome.
Now, in a minute, I am going to be reviewing this new Honda Civic Type R, but first, let's remind ourselves what made the old Type R such a hit, particularly among the sort of young men who have spiky product in their hair and communicate by grunting.
Him, really.
To be honest, there was plenty to like about this car.
Its engine spins so fast, it generates its own little gravity field.
I'm surprised it doesn't come with its own moon! There isn't that much actual power, but it makes up for that by being so urgent and so eager.
If you liken all cars to dogs - this one is like a pensioner's terrier - you just open up the door and it's Out, over your shoulder.
It handled nicely too.
It feels light and it feels agile.
If you turn into a corner with no power on, the back slides round, it's like an old-fashioned Peugeot - brilliant! Of course, it's like a tripod - always one back wheel off the ground.
Yes, I am a little terrier.
I'm cocking my leg now.
But it was the practical stuff that made this car such a hit.
It was cheaper to buy than almost all its rivals, and cheaper to insure.
And because the boot is so big, there's plenty of space for a decent pair of speakers - the most important accessory for the young man who made this car so popular.
ten pints of Stella and a dollop of chlamydia.
You would imagine then that the new Type R would be even better.
It's based on the new Civic, so it comes with funky triangular exhaust tailpipes, a dashboard from the Romulans, and door handles from a 1950s fridge.
It's very striking, but like the old model, it's not that expensive.
This GT version with satnav and various other luxuries is L18,200.
Equip a Golf GTI to the same level and it would be a whopping L5,000 more.
Unfortunately, however, from there on in, things start to go a bit wrong.
This car is bigger and heavier than the old model, so, d'you wanna guess how many more horsepowers it's got? Thirty? Forty? No.
One.
One more! Honda say, that despite this, this is just as fast as the old car.
They say it'll do naught to 60 in six and a half seconds, and that flat-out you'll be doing 146, but from where I'm sitting, it just doest feel that quick.
The revs just take longer.
It feels like a big car with a small engine.
Then there's the handling.
The old car was a joy in the bends because it had fully independent rear suspension.
Unfortunately, independent rear suspension is jolly expensive, so, in this, it's been replaced with a simple torsion bar.
That makes the car cheaper to make, and worse.
I'm not saying it's going to fall over or hit a tree, but, all the poise and controllability that you used to get in the old car, has just sort of gone, and all you get instead is, oh, I don't know about 15 miles of Look at this - hideous understeer! Still, let's see how this new car gets on in a race against its dad.
He's getting away! I'm gonna have to tuck in behind him here! Nothing I can do.
He's cocked his leg, his back wheel's off the ground.
Look at that! Look at that now - look at him! He's just roaring away! He's not only faster, but he's having more fun because it's just so much nicer to drive.
The whole point of a new car is it's supposed to be better than the one that went before, and this plainly isn't! Look.
Ooh, come on, come on, turn in! Off the track there - that's just the understeer killing the fun, killing the power, killing everything.
So, it's slower than its dad and then there's the spoiler, which goes right across the middle of the rear window.
I mean, who thought that was a good idea? And while we're on the subject of not very good ideas Can you hear that? That beep is to tell me the ignition key's still in.
Why? I know the ignition key's in, cos I've just driven here.
And then there's the um, then there's the seat.
Instead of having a wheel here, so you can infinitely adjust the backrest, you get a ratchet - so you either sit bolt upright, like you're at work, or you pull it and then you recline, like it's a chaise longue and you're a Victorian prostitute.
Oh, and how's this for a brainwave, OK? You pull up, you want to get something from the back seat, so, you pull that lever, pull the seat forward, get whatever it is that you wanted, pop it back, and it assumes that in the brief moment you were out of the car, you've become Richard Hammond.
Why doesn't it go back to where you left it? I mean, what were they thinking of? The worst part of this car though, is the ride comfort.
It's all right here on our smooth track, but on normal roads it is intolerable.
And it's not just me being a fat old man, I promise.
Even if you're a teenager, even if you're used to sleeping on the floor at parties and being stabbed, this is completely unacceptable.
You need a skeleton made of granite.
I like hot hatchbacks.
I always have done, but this one It's absolutely hopeless.
Out! You can't hide in there.
Get out.
What? That man, that man over there told me while we were watching that film, - that he's just bought one of these.
- Oh, that is awkward.
Sorry.
How do you feel now? I took them both out and I think that one's a much nicer car.
- What, the new one? - The new one.
The styling's a lot better, and also a higher rpm.
That sounds much nicer.
This one sounds like you're just thrashing it.
What if you're completely wrong? Which, because it's a different opinion to mine, you are.
The thing is, what we're talking about here is like a bad sequel, isn't it? Because this is Die Hard 1, - and then that's Die Hard 2.
- That is exactly right.
What I was hoping for here was Godfather 2 and what it is, is Police Academy 7.
That's Emmanuelle In Bangkok which wasn't as good Really? I wouldn't know about that.
All I do know is this is 18,000 quid, there or thereabouts.
You can buy a good tidy one of the old ones for about ten, and that's what I'd do.
And it's a Honda, so it'll be as reliable as the universe, it'll go on forever.
Absolutely.
And we must now find out how fast it goes, this one rather, goes round our track, and that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
Some say that he thought Star Wars was a documentary and that he recently pulled out of I'm A Celebrity because he's frightened of trees and Australia and Koo Stark.
And Ant and Dec.
All we know is, he's called The Stig.
And away he goes.
Not a particularly fast start, but then frankly, this really isn't a very fast car.
Talk among yourselves now.
There he is finally at the first corner.
Lots of tire squeal as he goes through.
The understeer seems to be just about under control so far.
ask the prospect if he can envision himself in the future with this product, service or opportunity.
Stig's learning how to be a killer salesman.
He drags it round Chicago in a lumpen and joyless way, and into the Hammerhead.
Turns in.
and lots of it.
If Stig could experience human emotions, he'd be feeling mild disappointment now.
Also remember that every dog has its day.
Success will prevail.
You're in the zone.
Yes, he is, he's in the VTEC zone and let's see if it can give him some speed.
Through the Follow-through.
Difficult second movie now coming into the difficult second to last corner.
That's 0K.
Up to Gambon.
Turns in, keeps it straight and tight and across the line.
Yeah, got the time here.
You're gonna be pleased by this.
You're gonna be pleased because it did it in one minute 16 point No, I'm lying.
It actually did it in 1.
33.
5, so, it's a little bit faster than a Golf GTI but a lot worse.
The styling's better.
Shut up! And now, the news, and I'm afraid it's very bad.
Jeremy Clarkson has a cold.
I have not got a cold.
I've got bird flu.
I have.
I'm living, breathing proof, soon to not be living or breathing, that it can jump species.
Wow, that means it's only one species away from humans, so we could all get it.
On with the news.
The government has a new solution for cutting congestion, which is to ban us all from driving to work.
Good, I can't drive, I've got bird flu.
They're going to introduce, for speeding, you get six points, which means two strikes and you're out.
On the plus side, they are talking about introducing that scheme where you get two points if you're only just over the limit.
No, no, no, they're scrapping that, I read this week, cos it goes against their policy of all speed of any sort kills, which actually isn't true.
I read a survey this week, which I've got here.
I brought it out with me.
OK, on country roads, rural normal roads out of a city, guess how many injury and, you know, death accidents are put down to speed? I dunno, rural, probably 50%, 60%.
- No, yokels.
80%.
- Four.
- 40%.
- 4%.
nothing to do with speed, so what is it then? - What causes the other 96% of accidents? - Yeah.
Because it's dark and it smells funny in the countryside.
Does anyone have any ideas? - What? - Tractors.
Horses.
No, I think the man with horses is onto something.
I genuinely believe it's animals.
People swerving.
You know, they've got their kids in the back, and swerve on the wrong side of the road just to miss some fox, which is just a rat.
- No, it isn't.
- It is.
No, a rat is quite small and has like a really bald long tail, and a fox is quite big and fluffy and has a big bushy tail, and a name - Basil.
You're not a country man, are you? - Not all of them are called Basil.
- No, no, it's like badgers, cos have you seen I bet you tune in, I do.
- Kate Humble's Badger Watch.
- Every week.
It's not what you'd think at all.
I tuned in, she was talking about some stupid little animal that basically is a chemical weapons factory spreading tuberculosis around the countryside.
People get it into their heads like you that foxes are cute and badgers are cute, and they're not.
I honestly believe, genuinely, that the country, cos we've established only 4% of accidents are caused by speed, and I bet most of those are bikers, so driving in the countryside is completely safe and would be better if you could get rid of all the animals.
You've got that the wrong way round.
You know Richmond Park outside London - everybody drives through there at 15 or 20 mph, because they're scared about running over Bambi, cos it's full of deer.
Then, as soon as they get to the city, where they'll only run over people, they all speed up and drive like lunatics.
So, what are you suggesting? Put the deer in the town.
Yeah, but actually If you empty the countryside of all the animals and put them in James, you've hit, for the first time in your life When I come to power, I'm gonna make you my minister of transport, - and you can implement that.
- Oh, there's a rosy future for us all! Now, I'd like to talk about a car.
Ooh! On Top Gear? No! Seriously, look at this, this is the Mercedes McLaren SLR Roadster, which is now officially the fastest convertible in the world.
That'll do 206 mph, with the roof down.
But, if a bluebottle flies over the top of the windscreen at that speed, and hits you in the middle of your forehead, it'll go straight through its own arse.
- I thought you'd say it'll go through your head.
- I was expecting that.
No, your head'll be fine.
Anyway, you know those Citroëns that have got a vibrating seat? And the idea is that if you nod off and stray out of lane on the motorway, the seat base vibrates and wakes you up and ooh, you can get back in lane.
I was talking to a girl the other day who got one, and she said she'd gone from London to Birmingham, deliberately on the hard shoulder because it was so nice.
The only problem with that is, is that in order to have this excellent facility, you have to buy a Citroën - Which is terrible.
- But now I've come across this.
- What is it? - Well, it's a seat base that you put on your car seat, like that, and then you turn it on and the middle bit vibrates.
You sit on it and it vibrates.
- You don't have to go over the lanes? - You don't need a Citroën either, you just have this.
The thing is, it's quite annoying.
I think it's probably not meant for you.
Is it meant for you? - No, I think you have to be a girl.
- Oh, yeah.
- They're like chaps but they've got - Want to come and try this out? She's blushing.
Come on, try it out.
Try out my captain's chair and tell me if that's good and you'd like that in your car.
- Are you ready? - OK.
Oh, that's good.
Does anybody else want a go? How can this be legal? Honestly, you can't drive while eating an apple or using a mobile phone.
But you can drive when you're all cross-eyed and sweaty! - That's 59.
99.
- So, it's more expensive than a Citroën.
But it's worth it.
Do you like the Dodge Viper? - Yeah.
- You do? Well, there's a new version out - here it is.
It's called the ACR, and they've squeezed more power out of the engine, the 8.
4 liter V10 - has 600 brake horsepower.
And you can buy what they're calling the hardcore pack.
- Really? - They'll strip out all the interior - carpets, radio, and that saves 40 pounds, which in America is lunch, isn't it? Anyway, can I make an important point? - Yes.
- You know petrol went past a pound a liter this week, and everybody's saying, "It's too expensive, we've all got to commit suicide?" But it isn't expensive at all.
It's cheap.
Well, it is, actually, because some mineral water I saw was L4.
99 a liter.
Exactly.
And it's a good job your car doesn't run on bull semen.
Well, it is, yes, but why? Because do you know how much bull semen is? D'you know, I can't remember off the top of my head.
L24,000 a liter.
- No way! - This is my point.
Seriously, I mean, petrol, they've gotta build an oil rig, float it out to sea, dig a hole with nothing in it, dig another, then another, then you get oil then you put it a ship, float it halfway round the world to another country, put it in a refinery, which is the size of a small county, turn it into petrol, ship it to a garage, put it in a flame-proof tank and sell it to the customer, and they're doing that for a pound a liter - I find that incredible.
Actually, no.
No, because the government takes 65 pence, so, they're actually doing that for 35 pence a liter.
- Exactly.
- And if you buy ten liters, you get a torch.
Well, there you go.
Oh, no, that said, I filled my car up with petrol a couple of months ago, - d'you know how much that cost? - Well, no.
- Ninety quid.
- No, L35,000.
You filled it up with bull sperm, you idiot! No, somebody nicked my The garage did that credit card thing - where they sell it to somebody.
- Oh.
Somebody's been running around in California spending my money on stuff.
I reckon he spent it on bull sperm.
Did you not notice the pump was different? Moo! It keeps mooving! Now it's chasing me! I don't want it any more.
I've got bird flu, be nice.
Now, Alfa Romeo has launched a replacement for its 156 which is called the 159.
Actually, James, that was launched two years ago.
Yes, it was, but we weren't paying attention.
Never mind, we like Alfas on Top Gear, so, I thought that, belatedly, I admit, I should go and find out what's what.
So, better late than never, here it is.
But before we get stuck in, we have to take care of some housekeeping.
I have here, the Top Gear Italian Car Road Test Cliché Swear Box, and every time I use a word like "soul" or "passion", or any bit of fake Italiano to describe this car, I've gotta put a pound in it.
Let me explain the problem.
For years, people who do my job, people who test cars, have only ever been able to say exactly the same thing about Alfa Romeos, and it is "Yes, the build quality is a bit ropey in places, "and the electrics will probably prove to be a bit iffy" "But we prefer them to BMWs, "because an Alfa's beautiful looks and gorgeous engine note "fill it with soul and passion.
" Oh, God! Anyway, you see the problem.
This is what Alfa Romeo is about.
To be honest, I could take the road test on the 156, which we did nine years ago, and just change the six to a nine.
Still, you never know, maybe this time things will be different.
Let's start with the looks.
That front end, those lights, that sweeping bonnet line, the striking grille, and it's the same story round the back.
Inside, there are lots of silvery bits and lovely dials.
In fact, there are two words that perfectly encapsulate the stylistic beauty of this car.
So, business as usual when it comes to appearances, but that could be the last time I put my hand in my pocket.
You see, Alfa Romeo has now put ein German in charge of the company, and he's a man who used to be responsible for things like BMW M series cars, and more recently, the Rolls-Royce Phantom.
Stuff that doesn't fall apart.
Apparently, he's passionate about build quality, and he's promising that the electrics will no longer be installed by a toddler group.
And he better be right, frankly, because this thing is now stuffed with electrical gizmos.
It's got an electronic key, it's got automatic climate control, it's got an mp3 compatible stereo, it's got parking sensors, you can have satnav and you can have an integrated mobile phone.
All this on a car which, at L22,500, is two grand less than the equivalent 3-series.
Now, we won't know if this quality regime works until you tell us what the 159 is like to live with, but for now, there's a more pressing issue.
The danger is that under this new regime, the alternator will work, the headlights will come on when you turn the switch, but the 159 will have lost its essentially Alfa you-know-what, and it won't drive with all the Alfa traditional diddly and doodah.
To find out, we need to take it for a good drive.
And for that, we've come to the River Humber.
It's an amazing feat of nature, which every day, drains one fifth of England.
My job today is to get from one side to the other, and to keep the Alfa on its toes, I'll be racing against a man.
Yes, it's another of our real life situation tests.
This is Graham Bowness.
He's rather tall and on this occasion, that's a good thing.
You see, the easiest and quickest way across the mile-wide river, is the magnificent Humber Bridge but in our race, neither of us is allowed to use it.
So, I'm gonna drive round the estuary the long way, starting here, go up here, bit of motorway, and then this series of spaghetti-like B roads, where I'll find out if the Alfa still has the soul and the passion.
And Graham? He's going to do something rather amazing.
He's going to walk across.
Is there a risk that you'll just get stuck? There is, yeah.
There's a risk that when I'm in the thick mud that's across there, exhaustion can maybe get the better of me and then I'll just, you know, pass out.
So, you haven't got a breathing tube or a small aqualung or anything like that? You can only breathe as long as your head is above the water, - and it will only just be above the water.
- Yeah.
- So you've either gotta make it or you drown? - Correct.
What else can I say but three, two, one Go.
Right, I'm not gonna be beaten by a man in a giant condom walking across a muddy river.
Graham's journey of 1.
8 miles should take him about an hour and a half, and my journey of 65 miles, should take me about the same.
I'll just tell you quickly about the new engine in this car while I'm in the village.
It's a 2.
2 liter petrol four-cylinder, it's very modern.
It's got words like "variable" written on the top of it.
There's a lovely bit in this engine as you get into the higher reaches of the rev range.
It really comes alive.
That's a quid in the box whatever that is.
As thousands of tonnes of tidal water tore away at Graham's muscles, I left the B roads for a quick motorway blast.
Here we go.
Get into fifth.
The great thing about an Alfa is, somehow the Italians do know how to make a car feel elemental.
But I suppose that's not surprising from a nation that gave us Verdi.
It was time to leave the motorway.
Ahead lay 35 more miles of B road.
Now it gets interesting.
Graham was past the halfway point, and despite his immense strength, he was struggling against the incoming 12 mph tide.
I was also struggling to keep hold of my money.
I'm just stringing this series of sweeping bends together, like someone who's really skilled at using a fork to roll up their spaghett Nice tight right-hander coming up here.
It's got a little kick and a shimmy from the front.
It's all frisky like one of those Peio ponies.
This is getting expensive.
The Alfa's handling had cost me dear - four quid, in fact but now we were in the final stages of the race.
Come on! This is it, this is the home stretch bit.
Come on.
I'm looking for the waterside beacon.
There it is.
That's the beacon.
Oh, for Pete's sake! I'd lost and I was broke.
Congratulations anyway.
- Thank you.
- Do you mind if I don't? Now, not so long ago, we in Britain bought more estate cars than any other nation on earth, but then all of a sudden, everybody decided that what they really wanted was a big 4x4 of some sort.
The problem is, though, that these days, if you drive a big 4x4 into a city, communists and ecologicals throw eggs at you and make rude gestures.
Obviously, one solution is to buy a 1963 Opel Kadett, preferably yellow.
- I called mine - No, Richard, that's not a solution, but I think I've got one.
What's the matter with going back to the estate car? For the same sort of money as a Porsche Cayenne or a Range Rover, you could have either of these.
There's the BMWM5 Touring or the AMG Mercedes E Class.
Both will take five people in comfort, in the same way that a Range Rover will take five people in comfort.
And it's not like you're wanting for space in the boot either.
In here, with the back seats folded down, I have been able to fit a massive 60 cubic feet of cheese, so if you're in the cheese-making industry, this is a very practical and impressive car.
Now, because the Mercedes is lower, obviously you get less space in the back, but you'd be surprised how close it is.
I've actually got And if you convert cheese into dogs, that's 4.
3 Great Danes.
And what's more, if I push this button here, the whole floor slides out, so, if this cheddar were a dog, it would be able to get in and out more easily.
Sadly, the BMW isn't quite as commodious, and the rear seats don't fold down flat, but it's still not what you'd call poky in there.
So, if it's space you're worried about, these cars are very nearly as good as the four-wheel drive alternatives.
They're also just children-proof.
I mean, yes, obviously there's a lot of leather and carpet back there, into which kids can rub jam and chocolate, but then, the back of a Porsche Cayenne isn't exactly a Fisher-Price ball pit, is it? So, what about the environment? Well, this is the Ape and Apple pub.
It's where the Manchester branch of Greenpeace meets to discuss polar bears and algae over a lovely pint of wheatgrass.
Now, the fact of the matter is, those cars produce about the same amount of greenhouse gases as a Porsche Cayenne Turbo, but, because ecohippies are so hung up on off-road cars, nobody's really paying them any attention at all.
In a whole hour, not one person pulled off their windscreen wipers or let down their tires.
And there's more good news.
These cars are more comfortable than any 4x4.
Yes, sure, the BMW crashes about a bit, but the ride in the Merc is sublime.
And so is its onboard entertainment, navigation command system thing.
The BMW's is far too complicated but even I can get this one to work without hitting it with a hammer.
- Your route is being calculated.
- There you go.
Easy-peasy.
Please turn right.
Now turn right.
And to shut her up, we just push that and she's silenced.
Please turn right in 100 yards.
is out here.
Neither could pull a horsebox up a slippery field, for instance.
I know this because neither can even pull themselves up a slippery field.
So, if you If you get stuck in a field, these cars are not ideal.
But what if you were to get stuck say, on the tarmac at Manchester Airport, when it was deserted because of a fire drill? Why does anybody buy a Range Rover Sport? If you want sport, get an M5, turn the traction control on, and mash your foot into the Axminster.
Like the normal M5, it's got a 500 brake horsepower V10 engine.
It's got a seven-speed flappy paddle gearbox with shift ferocity control.
It's got an electronic differential.
It is one of the most exciting cars made today.
your dog can come too.
OK, that's 100 mph.
Just watch these numbers come.
Remember, it's limited to 155.
That's 140.
Here we go, that's a 150.
I'm looking through a head-up display.
We're moving to now, 175 mph.
On a runway, you really do think "I'm gonna take off!" The bigger, softer, more practical Mercedes doesn't look like it could hold a candle to the BMW, but don't be fooled.
Because its 6.
2 liter V8 pumps out an astonishing 507 brake horsepower.
This thing is more powerful than a Ferrari F40.
It's more powerful than Mexico.
The extraordinary thing about the Merc is it doesn't have an electronic diff, it doesn't have variable anything.
You just wanna get in and go.
And then go some more.
And more.
So, which is quicker? Tell you what, let's find out.
I think that the BMW brakes better than this.
I think it handles better than this, I think it's quicker through the corners but as soon as you get this thing on a straight the BMW doesn't stand a chance! These cars then, they're both brilliant.
Sure, they can't off-road like a big 4x4, but they're so much more fun where you spend most of your time - on the runway at Manchester Airport.
Thank you.
- Come on then.
- What? - Which is best? - Which is best? Er, well, the BMW is more fun to drive and a teeny-weeny bit cheaper, and I think slightly better-looking, but, the Merc is bigger, more comfortable, more practical, faster, easier to use and it sounds like amplified thunder.
So, you'd have the Merc.
- No.
- Why not? - Because I'd have a Range Rover.
- What?! Why? Because when you drive a Range Rover, you get this warm, moist feeling inside that you're annoying Bill Oddie.
Now, here on Top Gear we're always on the lookout for new forms of motor sport, and this week, we think we've come up with a good one.
Traditionally, amateur racers go off for a weekend of motor sport, with a motorhome to sleep in and the car on the trailer behind.
But I've thought of a cunning way to streamline this whole business.
Just leave the car and trailer behind and race the motorhome.
I think this plan has a stench of genius about it.
You've still got something to get there in, something to sleep in, something to race, and you've still got something to go home in.
To test this theory, I've come here to Essex Raceway in Essex.
Home to banger racing, stock-car racing and from next year, the British round of the Formula 0ne world championship.
This is my motorhome, a Ford Midas.
Nice.
Now, let's meet my fellow competitors and their mobile motor sport racing living quarters.
In the Mitsubishi L300, we've got touring car star, Matt Neal.
In the Toyota Liteace we've got touring car star, Anthony Reid.
In the Chevrolet, we've got touring car star, Tom Chilton.
In the left hand drive Fiat Ducato NV70 Globetrotter, we've got touring car star, Mat Jackson.
And in the Transit, we've got desperate.
So, we have all sizes and shapes of luxury motorhome here, and all manner of engines and power outputs, and that's good, because it leads to the one thing you want most of all in motor sport - unpredictability.
And the unpredictability doesn't end there, because motorhome racing brings with it a whole new set of tactical decisions.
You see, the governing body of motorhome racing states in the official 2007 rulebook that you must prepare your motorhome for racing the night before the race.
Once the sun goes down, you may not make any further changes.
Which leaves you with a dilemma - do you strip it out and endure a terrible night's sleep that means you're not on form for the race, or do you leave the luxuries in place, and then face having to compete with all the extra weight onboard? I went for the strip it all out, have a bad night option and actually, so did all the other drivers.
Well, nearly all.
Gravy juice, pan, warm.
Peas, carrots, add.
Finally, everything was ready That's a pie.
for next day's big race.
Night descended over Essex.
Morning broke over Essex.
It was time to celebrate the birth of a new motor sport.
Great day for a race, this - Friday the 13th.
As one of the sport's co-founders, I was in car number one, and James was in car number six.
Turn it in, feed it through the apex.
There's quite a lot of understeer occurring.
Now, the point of this sport is that you should be able to drive your motorhome home again, so the rules are simple - Oh! Mind you, we had invited touring car drivers.
Right, we're three abreast.
This is gonna be a late braking competition.
Oh, no! Oh! I've just seen the door of the kitchen unit on the track, and that doesn't happen at Silverstone.
James' tactic of a good night's sleep wasn't working out.
He was at the back of the field, but he had a plan.
But the trick, I think, is to take a slow but inside line, so that, as they get carried away, I can sneak through on the left-hand edge.
The little red Toyota had no bulk and no power but was plucky, and we respected that for a bit.
But with some aerodynamic tweaks the Toyota found some speed.
No, the Toyota's gone through! Lap eight, and amazingly, James had managed to get lost on an oval.
I lost a bit of structural rigidity.
Oh, nuts! May have been a slight touch there.
Most of this will clean up.
Most of that will clean out.
I'm having a burst of power, and it's not it's coming from me own motor.
With just three laps to go, the red mist descended.
Luckily, my structure was still holding.
No, it wasn't.
Oh, Hammond's gone! Lightness is everything.
Whoa! That shelving unit was my downfall.
Bloody pikeys! Oh, right on my inside line! the little red Toyota was first, and I came home third.
Well, I think the "no contact" rule needs a bit of a tweak, but we are onto something here.
Like I said, you turn up in one vehicle, you sleep in it, you race in it and then you drive it home.
Well done.
So Were you impressed? Well, not really, because if I'd have been invited to take part in your new sport, I would have brought one of these.
It's made in Germany and it's called The Performance.
- Is it fast? - No.
It has a 12,000cc engine with a turbocharger, but it's quite heavy.
Why, what's in it? Well, let me show you.
Step this way.
- Do you need a ladder? - No, I'll be fine.
OK.
These stairs, for example, are granite - you can see the glitter.
It's all sparkly! I want that in my house! Well, there's a lot more you'll want in your house in here.
- The table's granite.
- I want that.
This work surface here, OK - you looking at it? It's sparkly, I want it in my house.
- Check this out.
- Whoa, what's that? - That's the plasma television coming up.
- I want that in my home! Come look at the bathroom.
There's a power shower - I mean, it massages you, OK? - And then, look at the floor.
- Oh, look at that! Look at the underfloor lighting and then look at these taps, OK? Just touch that and it comes on.
Ok, and that's blue, so it's cold.
Push that, it goes red when it's hot! And then, in there, is your bedroom.
Wow! You see, I don't think that's gonna work, because as I proved, if you don't strip all that stuff out, it'll be too heavy and you'll come last.
No, James, you're wrong, cos you haven't seen this thing's piece de résistance yet.
What you have to do is come down here like this, open this up, and there you are.
Wow! What I'm gonna do now is just lower that down.
Check it out.
Oh, that is brilliant.
Yeah! That is That is amazing! So, when this gets all smashed up in the race, you can drive home in your posh car.
Exactly.
That's what you need, Richard, to win a motorhome race, is ingenuity.
How much is it? - Er, and cash.
- How much? Er, well, excluding the car, this would cost you L750,000.
- That's a lot.
- It is.
You could almost buy a house for that.
And on that bombshell, it's time to end.
Thank you very much for watching.
See you next week.
Good night.

<|endoftext|>

Tonight, in a well-balanced show, James gets egg on his face, Richard runs himself over, and I power-slide the new Aston Martin DBS.
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Hello.
Hello and welcome to the show.
Meanwhile, next year sees the 40th anniversary of the formation of British Leyland, and we thought it would be a brilliant idea to celebrate this automotive milestone, but unfortunately the producers of Top Gear said there was nothing to celebrate, because BL was a miserable disaster and everything they ever made was rubbish.
And we said, well, yes, sure, the cars weren't terribly well built, and quite a lot of bits fell off, but even so, we insisted that some of the designs were quite clever.
There was a really big argument, which ended up with the people in the office saying to us, "If you think BL made a decent car, you go out and buy one.
" They gave us each L1,200 of our own money and then set us a number of challenges.
We were told to meet up at the Warwick Services on the M40, and Jeremy was first to arrive.
This is what I've bought.
It's a Rover SD1 styled to look like a Ferrari Daytona and it does.
This particular model has the 3.
5 liter V8 engine, and inside you will find plum-colored vulgalour upholstery.
It's got a stereo/radio cassette that doesn't work, it's got cruise control that doesn't work, an electric sunshine roof that doesn't work, er but, as a result of these small niggly little faults, I was able to get this bucket of magnificence for just 1,100 of my pounds.
The next contender arrived.
Wait, there's a car arriving here with no one behind the wheel.
It must be Hammond and it's a Dolly Sprint! - What d'you think? - Yeah, look at that! First ever production car to have 16 valves, four per cylinder.
Wow! And the first British saloon car to have alloy wheels as standard.
- Wow! - It's up there.
Now, I seem to recall Very sporty.
- But, hang on, real wood.
- I know.
The only thing is, they forgot to sand it.
You'll get splinters off it.
It's made out of floorboards - it's unbelievable! How much did you pay of your own money? - So, you've gone over.
- It's a classic.
It's desirable, people want these things.
I talked Richard through the Rover's little foibles.
A little known fact about the Rover SD1 is that it was longer on one side, because it wasn't very well made, than it was on the other.
Engine, good.
Gearbox, good.
Clutch, good.
- These had central locking, electric windows.
- Mm-hm.
- Didn't people used to get trapped and killed? - Yeah.
Your Dolly Sprint was the hot hatchback of its day.
- Very much so.
- So, what's May got? - Morning.
- And he's brought a piece of cheese.
- You brought a Princess, James.
- I have.
We're trying to prove British Leyland occasionally made good cars.
- You're not helping our case.
- Most interesting car they ever made.
And most radical and most modern.
Oh, look at the brown interior! Ooh! Brown, brown, brown.
It's brown and browner.
Brown was a '70s color.
This is a 1978 car.
It's very interesting, it's in good condition Why is it interesting? This was the first car in the world to obscure its wiper spindles under the bonnet.
Obscured windscreen wiper spindles - there's a reason to own one.
At the time it was important.
What's the suspension in this? Hydragas.
Very, very - It's very low.
- No, that's how it should be.
It's very low on that side and very high.
- It's actually broken, James.
- It's leaked.
This car, the Dolly Sprint, was driven in the Professionals.
This featured in the video of Don't You Want Me Baby by the Human League.
This was driven by Terry Scott in Terry And June.
- I know.
- Enough said.
Now, at this point, we'd normally receive our challenge, but spitefully, the production team said we had to drive 40 miles to go and get it.
To horse.
Come on! Yeah! Oh, God! Erm The key won't turn in my ignition.
Mine doesn't start at all.
Hang on, James.
Which slovenly Midlander built this? The steering lock's gone on.
God! I like it here.
- It's a shame to move from this glorious spot.
- It's a lovely morning.
I'm just letting my engine breathe, get some air.
Eventually the Rover screeched into life.
I got my Dolly going as well, and we were on our way.
Now, for our younger viewers, we should explain why the Top Gear office thinks the three of us have lost our marbles.
You see, some BL cars were quite badly built but most weren't built at all.
This is because the workforce spent most of its time outside on strike.
But still, we say that despite all this, some good cars did sneak through the net, and we were going to prove it.
I was full of hope, right up to the end of the slip road leaving Warwick Services.
My throttle's broken.
My throttle's broken.
Oh, God.
Hammond's in trouble already.
I got a hundred yards and it's broken.
I can't make the The throttle doesn't work.
In the lopsided Princess, James was unaware of my demise.
I think British cars of the 1970s were good.
We had this, we had Jeremy's Rover, great car.
The Dolomite Sprint that Hammond's got, great car.
They've given us these little cameras to film our various calamities.
We were expecting car problems and we've got them, but there's another one here - Jeremy's finger.
I was just seeing what was in here.
Has anyone got any butter? With some AA wire and some AA Lurpak, Jeremy and I were soon on our way.
Yeah! And quickly we caught up with James, so we could reflect on the brilliance of our cars.
Some great details on this thing, like the seat belt warning light, which flashes if you sit in the seat but don't put the seat belt on.
That sounds perfectly everyday now, but back then, that was radical, and annoying, because seat belts weren't compulsory.
It's almost as though this car was designed by futurologists.
I mean, this little slot down here is the exact size of a mobile phone.
Tomorrow's World never even saw the mobile phone coming and yet Rover did.
And here, look, the door mirrors are operated by this switch, OK? Now, the people who put that switch there knew it would break, so they put manual controls in as well.
Here comes Hammond, he's coming through.
Yeah! The noise it's making is Biblical! I shall now engage my fully-functioning overdrive by pressing this button.
Nothing's happened.
To get our first challenge, we'd been told to go to the old Morris factory in 0xford.
Unfortunately, when we got there, we found the plant now belongs to BMW who told us to go away.
So we were sent instead to the old Triumph factory in Canley, but when we got there, we discovered it had been turned into a hotel.
The only evidence of its existence was a few forlorn road names.
So, we were told to go to the old Austin factory in Longbridge.
Sadly, though, it had gone.
There's nothing There's nothing left.
I'd heard the Chinese had bought Longbridge.
I didn't know they bought all of it.
Everything.
How's your car holding up? I've got some odd squeaks and rattles.
I could actually make a fairly good drum solo out of various bits of trim in my car.
We decided to compare noises.
And before you knew it A requiem to Longbridge from the Top Gear British Leyland Trio.
That's got a certain something.
It was time to move on.
You opened the door wide.
I opened the door The door's still there! - It's come back to Longbridge.
- It's on strike.
Finally, I got past my stable door and we were off.
Well one of us was.
That did happen, that.
Yes, but that door, how it got stuck, I have no idea.
I've opened one door, now I'll open another.
Meanwhile, we did eventually get our cars started and we made our way to where they set us some challenges.
More of that later on.
But now it's time to do the news and Oh, God, there's a lot to get through.
We've got the Ferrari 430 Scuderia.
I've driven this now.
It's absolutely fantastic.
Unfortunately, we won't be able to show it to you because some idiot's crashed it.
Supposed to be filming it later this week, but that's not gonna happen.
Nissan, this is the GTR - this is gonna be the most exciting car of 2008.
We've just heard this week it goes round - Is it the Nurburgring? - It is.
It goes round the Nurburgring quicker than a 911 Turbo.
- Wow! - Can't wait for that.
Then of course, we've got the battle between the Subaru Impreza, the new one, and the Mitsubishi Evo 10.
So much good stuff! - Hammond, what have you got? - News from Korea.
The Kia Picanto, it's got a new front bumper.
- Look at that.
- Wow! Is that it? - Yeah, just the bumper.
- Anything else? Well, more news from Korea, actually.
You know the Hyundai Coupé? - Yes.
- Well, there's a new one coming.
Look.
That looks brilliant.
The trouble with the Hyundai Coupé is that it always looks quite good it's quite nice to drive and it's front-wheel drive and a bit sort of half-arsed, I always think.
Well, this time they're talking about putting a V8 in the front of that.
As it is, there's a V6, 300 brake horsepower, it's a light engine, or you can have a four-pot turbo.
- It is rear-wheel drive this time.
- It's rear drive? Yeah, and limited slip diff.
They're looking to take on the Mustang with it.
Even I like that.
- They'll be delighted.
- No, I do.
So, what news have you got, James? Well, actually, I've got some news from Korea.
You can't tell, can you, that Top Gear's just been sold in Korea? I think we're smoothing this one out nicely.
It's not showing.
Hello, you industrious little fellows.
That's got 'em on-side, well done.
From Korea, you know the Kia Cee'd? - Yes, what about it? - Cee'd.
Well, it's the fourth best car of the year.
Fourth best? It's the fourth best car of the year.
That's not even a podium finish, is it? What beat it? - The Fiat 500 was the winner.
- Mm-hm.
Third place was the Ford Mondeo.
And then fourth place, the Cee'd.
Then in fifth place was the Nissan Cuscus? Squishsquash.
Where's the Audi R8? It's not here.
Who here would have a Nissan Kumquat in front of an R8? It's a survey.
That's 0% of British people would do that.
What idiots have come up with that? Well, you see, it's the Car of the Year jury.
It's senior people from 22 countries, and they have a sort of pathological hatred of any car that's expensive.
They're just communists.
The interesting thing is, you see, a couple of weeks ago, remember I drove that Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead? - Mm-hm.
- I dunno, I thought that was better than the Fiat.
- I think it could be, yeah.
- More news.
You know the Hyundai Sonata? - Oh, Hyundai.
- Korean car.
- Mm.
- New front bumper, here it is.
New headlamps, new dashboard, new radiator grille - and I wouldn't have one.
- Me neither.
Honestly, things I'd rather do than drive one of those include presenting next week's show while gently cupping James' scrotum.
And we're We're off the air in Korea.
Goodbye, industrious little fellows.
Erm Oh, give me a minute, I'm gonna have trouble shifting that vision now.
You're gonna have trouble? We've also been sold, you'll like this, we've been sold in Australia.
We have, so we should probably talk about Australian cars.
- Is there an Australian here? - Yeah! - Yeah.
- We're now yours.
Yeah, you've bought us.
And so we must talk about an Australian car.
Yeah, er, yeah.
The XR8, that's Australian.
It isn't.
It's got an American engine and it was engineered by a Scotch.
- You're right.
- So, what else is there? - Erm - There's Erm Wasn't? No.
What Australian cars are there? - Falcon! - That's a Ford, you blithering idiot, that's American.
What did you say - you're no good at rugby and we've beaten you twice? That's what I heard.
Yeah.
I think we'll move on.
Now, have you ever wanted to buy a sports car that's got a diesel engine, top speed of 150 miles an hour, that's a high-riding 4x4 off-road car, and is also a four-seater convertible? - No.
- Neither have I, but Audi's made one anyway.
Here it is.
What do you do with it? I've no idea.
It's called the Cross Cabriolet.
Not as cross as the owner will be when he buys it and discovers he looks like Graham Norton's plumber.
But, the thing is, it's only a concept at the moment.
The trouble is, Audi have a habit of putting their concepts into production, but really, just no with that one.
You know the Morgan Aero 8, which was the first car ever made with cross eyes? We've got a picture of it here.
There you are.
I called it Clarence from the old Daktari programs.
Anyway, Morgan has now fixed the sort of squint.
The problem is, that they've decided that while they were at it, they would make a coupé version of the Aero 8 and it's called the Aero Max.
We've got a picture of that.
Now, I'm sorry, d'you know how much that is? L110,000.
You would have to be so mad to buy one of those, that you wouldn't be able to have a driving license.
You know who's ordered one, don't you? Ray Charles? Stevie Wonder? Who? - Who? - Him.
Yes, I have.
- Thanks for that.
- You've ordered one of those? - Yes, I have.
- Why? Because it's brilliant.
It's like saying "Well, you know, I've had marriage proposals this week "from Keira Knightley and Natalie Portman and Angelina Jolie, "but I've decided I'm gonna marry John McCririck.
" Very funny and everything, but you're wrong.
That is the last of the proper British sports cars.
- It's got a German engine.
- Yes, but the rest of it - And it looks like an insect.
- You drive a Spyder.
- Technically, a spider isn't an insect.
- Oh, shut up, James.
You've got a Panda, you know nothing.
- Can I say something here? - What? - I'm with Hammond.
- What, you like that? - I think it's terrific.
- When you said "I'm with Hammond" I thought you meant we were going out.
I would like to apologise to the nation and to the world, what's left of it, erm, what's left that's watching, for the level of blind idiocy this week, and now I'm going to move it on.
It's time for me to try a new Aston Martin out on our track.
There are two reasons I want to do that - one, it's a new Aston Martin, and two, I couldn't work out what it's for.
It's called the DBS and Aston Martin are very adamant that it's an all-new six liter, hard-driving lightweight thoroughbred.
I'm not sure about that.
To my mind, a thoroughbred car is Italian and flamboyant and it has its engine in the middle and it goes wrong all the time.
This is none of those things.
Yes, it has four nostrils in the bonnet, carbon fiber buttocks and carbon ceramic brakes.
But the engine's at the front, there's lots of storage space in the cabin, and it has a boot you can actually use.
It therefore isn't laid out like a thoroughbred, but who knows, maybe it'll drive like one.
OK, I'm gonna tell the adaptive suspension that I'm on a track.
There we are.
And here we go.
I like the steering.
I do like that and I like the brakes.
And I have to say, I'm also pretty fond of the tweaked differential they've put in, which means you can do this.
Yeah, look at that! I must say, the tires, which are specially made just for this car, by Pirelli, are brilliant.
Very good, excellent.
Wey-hey! It makes the right noises as well.
But, you don't get that same sense of terror that you get from a proper thoroughbred, like, say a Ferrari.
None of that sense of "Oh, my God, I've wet myself!" There's something else as well.
Hard, really, to put my finger on, but it feels Dunno, it just feels a little bit old-fashioned.
Maybe old-fashioned is unkind.
Maybe old school would be better, but either way, it's not a thoroughbred.
Perhaps then, it's a work of art.
There's no denying that it's bite-the-back-of-your-hand beautiful.
But is it better looking than a DB9? Well, apart from the racing paraphernalia on the DBS, they look pretty much the same to me.
Keira Knightley Keira Knightley in Puff Diddly's jewelry.
And it's all very well them saying the DBS is carbon fiber, it's only ten stone lighter than the DB9, and that's what, the weight of a medium sized woman.
So, it's not a thoroughbred supercar and it's not as good-looking as its sister.
Maybe then, we should view it as a replacement for the old Vanquish S.
The trouble with doing that though, is that the DBS's V12 produces and that's ten less than you got from the Vanquish's V12.
As a result, the Vanquish will do 200 mph.
This is out of puff at 191.
Come on! There are other problems too.
The interior is all marvelous - an amazing blend of carbon fiber, suede, and lots of exciting buttons you can't see or reach.
I especially love the gear lever which is like a Power Ranger's leg.
And then they go and let the whole thing down with this stupid key.
They call it, and I'm not joking, an emotional control unit.
Got one of those already.
It's called a government and I don't like that either.
This car then, is shaping up to be a bit of a misfit.
But don't worry, because there's one thing it does brilliantly.
Put it back in road mode and it becomes a stunning long-distance cruiser - an epic grand tourer.
I'd be happy to drive this all the way to the south of France, and I'd be happy if I got there and found I'd forgotten my swimming trunks, because then I could drive it all the way back again.
When you're on a motorway, it's smooth and civilized.
Quiet as well.
It is magnificent.
But even here, there's a problem.
Because if you want a good-looking and fast long-distance cruiser, what exactly is the matter with the DB9? It's easier to use, has the same engine, has two more seats, and it costs L50,000 less.
Yeah, but it's no good then? Oh, no, this is the best car I've driven all year and by a huge margin.
Hang on, you just said it's not at quick as a Vanquish, and it's not as pretty as a DB9.
And it's L50,000 more.
Yeah, the thing is, Aston Martin messed up.
When they said it's a thoroughbred, it's an all-new car, it isn't.
That's what threw me.
It's taken me ages to work it out but what this is, is a DB9 where every little piece is a little bit better.
I tell you what, this is the way to think of it - don't think of it as a DBS, think of it as a DB9S, like a DB9 Evo, and then it makes sense.
- Really? - Yeah.
- L50,000? - I agree, the price is a bit steep.
It's perilously close to the Ferrari 599, but honestly, you cannot buy a DB9 any more, you just can't do it, because one day, you will be sitting at a set of lights, someone will pull up alongside in one of these, and you will feel hopeless and inadequate and you will have to kill yourself.
Anyway, it is now time to see how fast this goes round our track, and that of course means handing it over to our tame racing driver.
Some say that he knows two facts about ducks and both of them are wrong.
And, that 61 years ago, he accidentally introduced her majesty the Queen to a Greek racialist.
All we know is, I'm going to the Tower now to have my head cut off, erm, and he is called The Stig.
And he's off, with a wheel spin and a V12 bellow.
Thundering down to the first corner.
It's wet out there today.
Let's see how that affects things.
Carving a pretty steady path through there, no problems so far.
Brilliantl What is my purpose? What would I want to accomplish? What values do I want to live by? Staying on his self-help odyssey there as he kicks the tail out.
Whoa, really kicking the tail outl In every way, this car's better than the DB9 including those superb new tires.
They might be struggling with the damp, mind you.
Looking pretty planted round Hammerhead and then, whoa, look at thatl What wall do I want to put my ladder of life against? Keeping it pinned open through the Follow-through.
Does he lift-off? Yes, then back on the loud pedal.
Down now to the last two corners.
Magnificent brakes, better diff, all doing their stuff.
A normal DB9 would be nowhere now.
Here he comes, slices through Gambon and across the line.
Yeah! Now Now, it did it on a wet track in one minute 27.
4, which is sort of here, in the middle of nowhere.
Thing is though, the track dried out just before we came on air, so I said to Tthe Stig "Quickly go out, do it again, get a time.
"Let's see how good this thing really is.
" One minute, 23.
9.
It's up here, it's with Koenigseggs and the Zonda.
It's the same time as the Zonda.
I mean, that is just staggering.
Brilliant.
Meanwhile, earlier on, the three of us each spent L1,200 of our own money, on three BL cars, in a bid to show that the old British warhorse did occasionally get something right.
Yes, and the producers of the show were keen to demonstrate that they never got anything right at all, so they came up with a series of challenges.
Yeah, and for every one we passed, we'd win money back towards the cost of the car.
Yes, so full of enthusiasm, we were sent to the MIRA Test Track - top secret place - it's where the motor industry tests all its secret new models.
It's just outside Nuneaton, on the A5, between Hinckley and Atherstone just before the A444.
If you get to Fenny Drayton, you've gone too far, you need to back up.
This is it, an automotive torture chamber.
An endless series of twists, bumps and corners, designed to find weaknesses in cars.
We would begin with timed laps on the handling circuit.
And to spice things up, we'd have to beat a time set by The Stig in a Datsun 120Y.
This was the little Japanese car that showed our dads they didn't have to have a flaky Austin 1100 that broke down all the time.
- How many BHP is it? - 69.
- Wow! - 69 horsepowers! Every single cold morning, Britain echoed to the sound of "eh-eh-eh" as nobody's car started, then along came that, which showed the world cars could be reliable.
- Yes, but reliability is so tedious.
- It's boring.
Here he comes now.
He's coming up to the triple right here.
Ooh, he's locked up, terrible brakes.
- And across the line in? - One minute eleven.
- One minute eleven seconds? - Yes.
With nearly twice the horsepower of the Datsun, naught to sixty in 8.
7 seconds and double wishbone suspension, I would destroy the Datsun's time.
Go.
My washing machine moves around the kitchen faster than that.
Come on, little fella.
Richard, it's for you, it's for Triumph, it's for British Leyland, it's for Britain! - Hairpin, hairpin.
- Here we go.
This is where the sophisticated suspension will help him.
Will not help help him.
Smooth! That's the slowest I've ever seen a car move.
did give my electrics a good shake.
Every now and again, the radio comes on.
That's my radio.
Yeah! I think we did well.
Jesus! - Yeah, fifty-eight seconds.
- Yeah, yeah, brilliant.
If you're watching this in Japan, there you go, you see, you're not so clever.
Eh-heh! - What was it really? - One sixteen.
Oh, God.
Nice one.
- Well done.
- Yeah! - Well done.
Excellent.
- It felt good.
Now, let's see if we can give the Datsun another thrashing, with some Rover V8 muscle.
No need to worry about traction control - doesn't have it.
Ohh, that was a wheel spin! That's not fast.
Oh, yes, feel the grip! That wasn't a sophisticated car, despite looking modern, was it? Oh, not at all, no.
The suspension was from the 1950s.
- And it's not a sophisticated man driving it.
- Yes! Ohh, what was that? - A lot of grass.
A lot of grass.
- It was off-road.
It does sound good, though.
Well, no, it sounds terrible.
Crossing the line! Unfortunately Got smoke.
some oil had come out and was sort of on fire, but no matter.
Ah! Your time.
Yes, my time.
One minute eleven for that.
Yes, and - What? - One minute twelve.
It was.
That's impossible.
Look, even with Ray Charles at the wheel, you could get this round faster.
Well, you didn't.
So now, terrifyingly, the pride of a nation rested with Terry Scott.
Beautiful smooth six-cylinder engine.
That is just a rubbish sight.
It's automatic as well.
The uneven suspension didn't help Bloody Nora! but that wasn't the biggest problem.
Cock, gone the wrong way.
What are you doing, man? You idiot! You stupid long-haired idiot! I don't think it will have affected the time too badly.
It was never gonna be good, but OK.
- Oh, I dropped it.
- Oh, that's cos it was better.
Are you gonna break it to him or shall I? - He must know.
- He must feel it.
He can't feel that went well.
- So? - He feels it went well.
- What? - I dropped the stopwatch.
- Yeah.
- So, what was it really? Well, I dunno, I dropped it.
- 1:02? - Not, not I think we all have to accept that after the power challenge, where we should have done well, we haven't.
No.
So, we've made How much money have we got back then? - Nothing.
- None at all.
So, never mind, we'll move on to the next challenge.
Here it comes.
"As you can see, The Stig's Datsun is now parked on a one in three hill.
" Yes.
"It is being held, no problem at all, by its handbrake.
"You will now park your cars there, put them in neutral, apply the handbrake, get out.
"You get L100 if it stays where it is.
" It's a simple test.
Yours is pointing in the right direction.
You go first.
It is steeper than you think.
It is very steep.
Actually, it is a bit steeper than it looks.
Right, stopped on the foot brake.
- Ooh, would you get out of that now? - No.
His foot's still on the brakes, look.
I'm not sure.
What's he doing? That's the quickest I've ever seen him move.
- How's that? - You're there.
- L100.
- Thank you.
What a machine, the mighty Princess, yeah.
Genuinely pleased about that.
- Watch this.
- Yeah, I'm going to.
I was feeling confident about this test.
All I had to do was get to the stopping point.
God, it is steep.
I've never seen that before.
Happily, the wheel spin generated so much smoke, the car was hidden from view.
I therefore claimed I'd done it, and then it was Hammond's turn.
- There he is, parked.
- Oh.
No, that's not working for me at all.
Er His foot's out, his arm's out.
OK.
Ah, that's not gone well.
Sorry, that's gone badly wrong.
It's gonna come Oh! Sorry.
Having failed the test, he's knocked down the sign warning you how steep the hill is.
Still, every cloud and all that.
Good test of how fast it goes backwards with the handbrake on.
So, we tested the performance and the handbrakes and now it was time to look at ride comfort.
Thank you very much.
OK.
"New cars are tested on MIRA's rough road at 20 mph.
"You will drive down it at 30 mph.
" I may not excel at this one.
"Attached to the roof lining of your car is a colander full of eggs.
" "The more your car shakes about, the more egg will end up in your hair.
"Each gram of egg left in the colander at the end equals L10 paid into" Who? This is the well-known industry egg test.
Who thinks of this stuff? There's no egg cap rating, is there, for new cars? Euro egg cap! We also learned that we'd lose money for any pieces of trim that were dislodged by the savage cobbles on MIRA 's rough road.
Oh, God, it's rough.
- Here he comes, here he comes! - Yeah.
Ah, got egg in my eye.
Got egg on the wheel.
It's a warm day as well, let's be honest.
Oh, and the glovebox has gone and the radio panel.
Look at that suspension working.
How's he looking? Eggy.
He looks like a spaniel that's crashed into the back of a hen.
Ah! What's happened to you? I got covered in eggs.
Where's your colander? Above my head.
Where the hell did you think it was? Could've been worse.
Pretty much all of them.
How many were there? Five eggs.
There's a bit left in the bottom.
The only thing that slightly worries me looking at you Is that one of my eyes is welded together with egg? - No.
- That doesn't worry be at all, no.
This is the most comfortable car here.
Yes, it is.
Which meant that with my sports suspension, I was likely to become a human omelet.
Right, we're off.
Accelerate up to 30 mph.
The glovebox has gone.
It honestly isn't looking as bad as your car.
It is now looking as bad as your car.
Not enjoying it at all.
It's gone down my neck.
Oh! Something just came off.
The bumper.
It's not going well.
Ow, please just break! Oh, the sun visor's gone.
I was working out the other day how many classics Led Zep I mean classics like Stairway.
Oh, dear.
It wasn't even worth measuring the egg residue, because I'd lost so much money for bits falling off.
Door mirror, glovebox lid, oh, and this funny thing.
That's three.
- And this.
- Four.
- And that.
- Five.
- Technically, that.
- Six.
I fired up the Rover.
It does that.
- I have more on the front.
Why's that? - Mine was They could only mount it on I have to sit further forwards than you, cos I'm short.
That's what it is.
Oh-ho-ho, no! Now, that looks pretty poor.
Coil springs absorbing all the bumps nicely.
There's a lot of weight on those springs.
Ooh! That was the door.
Having fun? Still, I'd only lost one thing.
Two things.
sunbleached.
What you need to do is find a bit that's not been exposed.
British racing green was an official color.
No worries.
Except I desperately needed to wash my hair.
Oh, get off, Jeremy, that's disgus ting! I don't know what's worse I've just wiped my hair on a seat that's 30 years old, and has had some Midlander's bottom on it.
So, I borrowed MIRA 's wet weather skidpan.
Yeah, now, I'm drifting and washing my hair - it's a world first.
You're drifting, I'm drifting off.
We'd tested speed, handbrakes and ride comfort, but there was one more thing.
I was told to weld my door back in place, and report with the others to the Top Gear test track, in dry suits.
- Mine doesn't fit.
- Oh, stop moaning.
- It doesn't fit.
- Just pull it.
There you go.
Oh, it's like watching it give birth to a thing.
We were given the challenge.
What? "Your cars will now be filled to the brim with water, "and then you will drive round the track.
" That explains it.
- How will you breathe? - It doesn't say.
It says "When the water level drops below the bottom of the steering wheel, you will stop.
"The person who covers the greatest distance is the winner.
" Yeah, the water will come out of all the panels that don't fit properly, so, the quicker the water comes out, the less well made it is and the shorter distance.
There's a speed side of it as well.
If water's going to be gushing out and you've got a really fast car, you'll go miles.
Actually, it's quite a thorough test, because it tests performance, and build quality for the water, it's pretty thorough.
It does say you go first.
- Right.
- So, off you go.
- See you.
- Right-o.
You'll be the first person ever to drive a car underwater.
- Were you making it up? - Yes.
The cars would be filled by fire trucks, and to make sure they didn't leak so badly that they couldn't be brimmed with water, the doors were sealed with gaffer tape.
You could've used warm water.
It's freezing.
Oh, there's 30-odd years worth of fag ends and fluff coming up on top.
Look at it going up the window.
It's fantastic.
Oh, I can hear him.
Go, go, go! The extra weight did blunt the Dolly's performance.
- And he's leaving a big trail.
- That's a big trail of water.
Fortunately, because the water came out so quickly, I was soon able to pick up some speed.
One thing they said is that the weight of the water is so immense, that as you go round a corner, you could slosh over to one side and roll over.
Imagine filling the insurance form in on that.
"Well, how did he drown?" - This is gonna take more than that little - Little box.
Despite the Dolly's leakiness, I made it past Hammerhead.
That's fallen out.
Whoo! I better be honest, that's just dipped below the steering wheel now.
He's stopped.
He's stopped just before the Follow-through.
More than half a lap.
Moe than half a lap.
D'you think you can beat that? Let's see.
Here we go.
Oh, look at this.
One of the issues with the Austin Princess we're able to determine now - very badly fitted door handles.
It should've been called the Austin Colander.
Even so, it was filling quite well.
This is a great sport.
And I checked to make sure James' snorkel was working.
And go! Wow, look at the speed! The other great thing is, James still has no idea how to drive round this track - he never does power tests.
Oh, he's doing it right, about at the same speed Terry Wogan went round in.
Nevertheless, James was doing brilliantly.
I'm gonna pass Hammond.
There it is, yes! In fact, the Princess could hold its drink so well, he did a full lap.
- He's not cheating, I can't believe it! - He's still there! And then he passed Hammond againl Yes! Yes! And I've just lost it.
- You've been lapped by Captain Slow.
- Doesn't happen every day.
In an Austin Princess full of water.
- Right, bring on the Rover! - Yeah! The water thundered in This is quite cold now.
and came straight out again.
We're having to use two hoses because your Rover leaks so badly Rubbish! I was only bothered about my secret weapon.
Yeah, height adjustable.
- He's lowered it.
- Cheating Two hoses still weren't enough.
We're gonna have to put a third hosepipe in to fill it.
Jeremy, it's not filling up.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.
Eventually, we became bored and the tankers became empty, so we sent him on his way.
Go! Yeah, feel the power.
It's looking good.
Oh! The damn door's come off.
- That's quite a big panel gap you've got there.
- That is quite a gap.
You lost that badly.
- You're last place, mate.
- In that test.
That That wasn't even the door that you welded back on? No, I'll tell you exactly what happened here.
This car, this Rover, has been lightly restored by some previous owner, who was probably an ape.
It's a good point, because my dad had three of those and none of the doors ever fell off.
It's not Rover's fault, they were built brilliantly.
In fact, I seem to remember at the time, the SD1 was often praised for the way its back doors stayed on.
Exactly.
No, no, it was one of the key features of the car.
Anyway, now, we've gotta do some totting up.
We've got the chart over here, I've got a pen.
Now, this is what we paid for the cars.
We were given L100 if we could get to the top secret test track on the A5, without any mechanical problems.
- I didn't do that.
- No, I didn't do that.
- I didn't do that.
- So, that's no pounds to us for that.
The power test against the Datsun.
- Nothing? - No.
No, naught there coming back.
The handbrake test.
I didn't do that either.
No, it was a sad moment that, it was no pounds back for you.
- I did.
- You did.
- That's L100.
- And you? I did it as well.
Well, we never saw you do it, but if you say you did it, then, Jeremy, you did it.
- Absolutely, so that's L100 back to me.
- Yeah.
Er The egg test.
An important test.
Yeah, now I had four grams of egg left but I lost two trim pieces, so that's I'm L20 up.
- L20 up for James, well done.
- Well done.
I had four grams left and I lost two trim pieces, one of them was quite large, I admit, but nevertheless, L20 up.
Richard? I had no egg left at all and six trim pieces fell off, so I'm L60 down.
- Yeah, you're minus 60.
- That's not going well for the Dolly.
- A let-down for BL, I'm sorry.
Now, the water test.
Yeah, now, this we got 20 pence for every yard you covered.
- You did 1,500 yards, so - Yes.
- That's um - It's L300, you halfwit! It was right on the tip of my tongue.
Yes, L300 back, well done.
I did I did 4,500 yards, which I think you'll find is L900.
- Well done! - L900! That's better than going on The Weakest Link.
L900.
- And you did ten yards, Jeremy.
- That's L2.
- Every little helps.
- Put it on.
OK, so, let's tot it up, let's see how we did.
OK, so, Richard, you are L1,010 out of pocket, that's minus.
I'm L978 out of pocket.
- Well done.
- And James, you are you're L20 in the black! - Oh, brilliant! James is the winner! Thank you all.
Congratulations.
You You have proved You've proved to the producers of the show, you've proved to the nation, and indeed the world, that British Leyland did make a good car, and here it is - a beige Austin Princess with a brown vinyl roof.
Yeah! Yeah, Britain made a good car.
Yeah.
- Well done, James.
- Thank you.
There was only one.
- Just that one.
- They were rubbish.
And on that bombshell, it is now time to end.
Thank you very much for watching.
Take care.
Bye!


Tonight, Compo takes me for a spin in a car from his youth, Richard tries to drive a fast car without crashing, and Lewis Hamilton faces his toughest test yet, the Suzuki Liana.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello, and welcome to the BMW M5 which is very expensive.
However, I know of a car which does all the same sort of stuff for half the price.
So that's got to be worth a look, even though it is a bit Australian.
Welcome, everyone, to the VXR8.
Like the M5, it's a spacious four-door, five-seater saloon car, with much leather, many buttons and a large boot.
Like the M5, it'll bumble about all day quietly and comfortably.
And, like the M5, it's capable, when the mood takes you, of being absolutely and completely bonkers.
This could only have come from a country that hadn't signed up to the Kyoto Treaty.
For such a big, comfortable car, it's staggeringly easy to drive very really fast.
It's got a six-liter V8.
That's 414 horsepower.
Naught to sixty? Less than five seconds.
Its top speed, if you take the limiter off, about 175.
And that's pretty quick.
And it's yours for just L35,000.
Now, for that sort of money, what you'd normally be looking at is a three-liter BMW 5 series, or a 3.
2- Liter Audi A6, or a 2.
8- Liter Mercedes E class.
They're all very nice cars, they really are, but they're not really in the same league as the big V8.
They're all lost in my six-liter shockwave.
In a simple drag race, it completely trounces them.
And we see much the same thing in the corners.
Out of the way, Germans! Thank you.
This, then, delivers M5 power games for L30,000 less.
So what exactly are you missing out on? Well, first of all, the BMW comes with a BMW badge, and that is worth its weight in myrrh.
Whereas this is being sold in Britain as a Vauxhall.
What's more, inside, it's a bit like a Currys own-brand stereo.
And of course, with such a big engine, it's not what you'd call economical.
And then there's the exterior.
With all its trinketry and Price Drop TVjewelry, it's not exactly a wallflower.
But the main reason why this is L30,000 cheaper than an M5 is simple.
It's about 30,000 times less complicated.
In an M5, there are seven different settings for the gearbox.
There are two for the differential.
You can even choose how much power you want from the engine.
It's like a Poggenpohl kitchen.
It's very hi-tech, very German, very nice.
This, though This is more like a barbie.
Honestly, I'm surprised you don't pour beer on it when you want to turn it off.
You push the middle pedal when you want it to slow down, you turn this big, circular thing in front of you to make it go round corners, and then you push the pedal on the right when you want it to make more noise.
This car, then, it's as dainty as a hobnail boot, as feminine as a burst sausage.
And I've got to say, I love it.
Erm You see, every week we get a stack of letters, and literally none of them ever asks what was the first car ever to be laid out in a way that we accept as being normal now.
- Good.
Moving on - No, no, no.
It's a very good question that's never been asked.
We have the steering wheel in front of you, the clutch on the left, the brake in the middle, the throttle pedal on the right.
You've got the gearstick there and the handbrake there, but what was the first car to be like that? No, no, James and I decided - good idea - to go down to the Beaulieu Motor Museum, and see if we could find the answer to a question that no one is asking.
Because no one cares.
This is the very first car ever made.
The Benz Patent Motorwagen from 1896.
This is Genesis.
And it's absolutely nothing like the cars we know today.
For a start, it has this tiller steering arrangement, which is exactly the sort of thing you'd find on a canal boat.
And it also only has a single front wheel, so presumably, if you were a bit too vigorous with this, the whole thing could topple over.
Performance? Not great.
It has a one-cylinder, one-liter engine, which gives a top speed of nine.
And with a 1.
5- Liter fuel tank, its range is only five miles.
Tricky when the petrol station hadn't been invented.
But it did show the world that personal motorized transportation was possible.
Three years later, the British came up with this.
The Royal Enfield.
That's not the brake! No! Its controls were hideously complicated.
But there were some good points.
This had twice the power of the Benz.
Two horsepower.
But most important of all, it had four wheels, so what they accidentally designed here is the quad bike.
One of the biggest problems with these early cars is getting them going in the first place.
The starter motor hasn't been invented yet, there's no ignition key.
You have to use the starting handle.
And the great thing about this particular car, the De Dion-Bouton, is that when you turn the handle, it will break your wrist.
- You what? - Seven members of staff at the museum have had their wrists broken by this very car.
We don't actually need to drive it.
We can just talk about it.
This is one of the first cars that sold in great numbers.
We have to know what it was like.
- You're going to have to get it going.
- Urgh! Having got it started, we needed to get it moving, and for that we had a copy of the original handbook, which had been translated from French, 'cause the car was made in France, into English.
Literally.
"For making the carriage walking at the first speed, "take back the drag of the wheel backward crowbar of the right, "and take completely and progressively the crowbar of embrayage to you, while you" "Hurl the mover till his starting.
" Argh! Aha! I can understand why this is better than going around looking at a horse's bottom, but how did anyone ever figure out how it worked? If we've established that that's the gear lever, and that's the advance thing, the ignition, and that's something important, this was designed for someone with three arms and one leg.
- It was.
- But if you need to do a hill start, you have to steer it with your chest.
Or your face.
It would be difficult.
How do I get it into top gear? "For taking the second speed, push rapidly at the crowbar forward without brutality.
"When it is raised up again it gains all its strength.
" - Yes! - Yeah! Top gear! - Now, how do I stop? - What? Well, I'm going to have to stop eventually.
This road won't go on for ever.
- "Hurl the movements" No.
- Seriously - I don't know, James.
- It's quite important.
Find it.
- You're in charge of the instructions.
- They're in gibberish! There's no point in relying on this.
I brought them as a joke for the viewer.
Oh, God, there's a "For making the carriage completely stopped, "when it goes at 15 kilometers an hour, take abruptly the crowbar of embrayage" - Right.
- No, no, wait, we haven't finished.
- You haven't got long.
Come on.
- "When you are in first speed, "push" We aren't, are we? James, we're going to be killed! I decided to use ingenuity.
- I'm using friction.
- That's neutral.
I've got neutral.
- It's my wind resistance.
Stop it! - I don't know how to do it.
- Make it stop! - I don't Right.
Ohh! So, France hadn't got it right, and nor had America.
This is the Stevens Derailleur, which has eight clutches, and what kind of dullard would think that that was brilliant? That's brilliant.
What's brilliant? This gearbox.
This is a three-speed constant mesh.
So those are constant mesh gears and it has selector forks.
But it doesn't have dog clutches.
So that's like the brake band on an automatic gearbox, in fact.
In a modern gearbox, one would always be loose on its shaft, either the input shaft or the lay shaft.
That's 1903, and that is basically what You might imagine that the first car to get everything in the right order was the first car ever to be mass-produced, the Model T Ford.
By the time it went out of production in 1927, half the cars in the world were Model Ts.
So you'd imagine that all the cars that came along afterwards would be laid out in the same way.
Luckily they weren't.
Honestly, I'm glad this didn't catch on, because driving a Model T is more complicated that doing eye surgery.
It's almost as though Henry Ford was being, I don't know, deliberately obtuse, because to make it move, you have to up the revs with the accelerator, which is here, on the steering wheel.
Then you move the handbrake to the middle, which somehow puts the car in neutral, and then depress the left pedal.
Yeah! The only problem is, to maintain this speed I have to keep my foot pressed hard down on what feels like a very, very heavy clutch pedal.
And the pain in my thigh is excruciating.
The only way round this is to change into top gear.
Now, to do that we have to go faster, push this lever, the handbrake that isn't a handbrake, all the way down, and then I can take my foot off that pedal.
Now the speed shoots up, whether you like it or not, to about forty.
And forty, on wooden wheels in a world with hardly any roads, is terrifying.
Jeremy and I were beginning to believe we'd never find the first car with what we'd now call conventional controls.
But then we stumbled on this the Cadillac Type 53, from 1916.
Look! A handbrake and a gear lever in the middle of the car, and three pedals in the right order.
And better still, no starting handle, no broken wrists.
This was the first car to come with one of these.
This may look as old-fashioned as all the other nonsense from the early days of motoring, but what we have here is the nub, the first properly modern car.
The thing is, that nobody knew when this came along that they had actually hit on what would become the template for all cars in the future.
Exactly.
This bright idea could easily have been snuffed out by the next bright idea.
No.
But what made this bright idea stick what that a British chap called Herbert Austin, who I'm sure you know, came along, copied all the ideas and put them on his car for the people, which was, of course - The Seven.
- The Seven.
Exactly.
This car cost just L125, four times less than the Cadillac.
What's more, it was built under license by BMW in Germany, and copied too by Datsun in Japan.
This car, then, the little Austin Seven, took Cadillac's bright idea, showed it to the world and made it stick.
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Goffey and Tony Mason there.
No, no, thanks.
Really, thanks, lads, for wasting nine minutes of my life.
- I'll tell you something else really interesting.
- Not with a knife sticking through your neck.
- No, seriously.
During the war - Oh, God, no, not James May on the war! Please! Isn't it time you put a star in our reasonably priced car? It is time we put a star in the reasonably priced car.
My guest tonight once sang about a semi by the sea, and funnily enough, James May once had a similar experience but when a dreadnought sailed by.
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt! - Yes! How are you? - I'm very well.
So you've taken two years to get here.
Have a seat.
Excellent.
I'm honored that you should come down, and thank you for that.
- Thanks.
It's been a nice day out.
- Good.
Good, because you're the first guest we've ever had who can drive a tank.
Yeah.
I think you'll see in a minute that I can't drive a car, though.
Yes, but you see, your problem is that your car history's rubbish.
I mean, we have sometimes had guests on who have just had appalling car histories, but yours You've only owned, is it one car? I have, I'm afraid to say on this program of all programs, owned a Lada Riva.
I haven't finished, actually.
It was a Lada Riva SL 1300.
SL's for Slightly Luxurious.
It was racing red, or Ferrari red, whichever you choose.
- They weren't bad cars, those Lada Rivas.
- Yeah.
Actually, it did have bucket seats, and I installed an enormous great stereo in it, which, sadly, was nicked one day.
I think it's actually even more embarrassing than owning a Lada to nick the stereo from it.
Why have you never replaced it with another car? Presumably you can afford one now.
- Because I owned a motorbike after that.
- Oh, did you? - Yeah, a Moto Guzzi - I didn't know you were homosexual.
Yes, absolutely.
Most of my songs are about you.
Oh, God, no.
I've got all kinds of lyrics going through my head now.
Which bit of the army were you in? The Lifeguards, part of the Household Cavalry, so reconnaissance, and that's why we had very small tanks.
- Were they like diet tanks? - Yeah, a Scimitar.
A main battle tank's about 77 tons, and mine was about four tons.
Did you see in the paper on Wednesday the EU is saying there's got to be emissions legislation for military vehicles? - Did you see that? - I have heard about this, yeah.
We're going green in the army.
How can you worry about the pipe at the back when the pipe at the front, there's depleted uranium coming out of that one.
"Yeah, I know, but look" - We're just trying to make war a bit safer.
- Yes.
It's a good job you aren't in the army now, I have to say that.
Yeah, it's a pretty miserable time, I think, to be in the army.
They're working incredibly hard, doing a really tough job and not under great circumstances.
You know the covenant that's supposed to exist between us and them? They all say it's gone.
I was talking to one the other day, a chap called Mark who's had his leg blown off in Iraq, and he came back and all we gave him was MRSA.
- Yeah.
- And I don't think that's really fair.
- I know you're a patron for Help For Heroes.
- You are, too.
I do the same thing, because there aren't many funds for the army, particularly for equipment, but more so, even more important, for those who get injured, when they come back.
Now, you were in the army skiing team, cavalry skiing team? Yes, they sent me skiing for about three months every single year.
It's not all fun, fun, fun! No, it's hard work.
Didn't they name a chairlift after you? - I had a chairlift named after me, yeah.
- Because you spent so much time I had to crack a bottle of champagne on it and say, "I name this chairlift James Blunt.
God bless her and all who ride me.
" But you did actually have to go to Kosovo, didn't you? It wasn't all Yeah, in '99, during the war there, the bombing campaign and the peacekeeping afterwards.
- Was it very horrible? - Yeah, war's a pretty miserable place.
So was the Kosovan Albanians and the Serbs murdering each other.
'Cause you were Weren't you the first in? Across the border, yeah, and the first one to Pristina with my troop of soldiers.
Really? The very first one in? That's quite something.
- And you had your guitar on your tank.
- Strapped to the outside.
It was a precious guitar, I wanted it inside, but I was told by my superiors I had to keep the soldiers on the inside.
I wasn't allowed to strap them on the outside.
And you just made sweet music in there.
Do you inhale helium before you sing, or is that just how it comes out? - I was fed it as a child.
- Fed helium? I think if I sang and inhaled helium, it would be beyond the human ear's register, wouldn't it? - Only dogs would hear it.
- Argh, no, make him stop! You do actually take the mick out of your own songs at gigs, don't you? Well, have you heard them? Now, let's just get this.
I'm confused by this.
Genuinely, OK? Your first album sold, what, twelve million? Something like that, although my mother bought about a million, so I did have a helping hand.
- And I've got a million.
- We have a warehouse about the size of this, full of my albums.
And then the new one, All The Lost Souls, that's flying out, isn't it? So why are you voted number four in the list of the hundred most irritating things in Britain? That really pisses me off, actually.
I thought I'd at least do better than that.
You did beat traffic wardens and you beat men in flip-flops.
Well, I tell you, next year! - I'm going for the number one or two spot.
- Climb it up.
You have packed a lot into your life.
Obviously, there's the army stuff.
You had a pilot license at 16.
Do you still fly? I'm normally just in the back.
If you ever find yourself in a plane with me, you should jump.
Why did you go and learn to fly? My dad was a helicopter pilot in the Army Air Corps.
- What did he fly, Lynxes? - Yeah, Lynx, and Gazelle Scout before that.
Which they're still flying now, out in Iraq.
Exactly.
In fact, my brother-in-law, who's here tonight, has got a Scout.
He's got one or he flies one? He's got a Scout.
He flies one and he's got one.
I found him on eBay.
What, you found your brother-in-law on eBay? Or the Scout on eBay? No, what happened was, I found my sister who, again, is here tonight, crying in her flat because she couldn't get to a funeral in southern Ireland.
The planes were on strike and the ferries were out of season.
Obviously, no trains to Cork in southern Ireland, so I put my sister on eBay as "A damsel in distress needs a knight in shining armor.
What can you do?" - And this fool started bidding, amongst others.
- You put your sister on eBay? Yeah.
And anyway, he bid and bid amongst others and he won.
He had a helicopter, a Scout, so he could fly her to the funeral, and some six months ago, they got married.
- No way! - Yeah.
You put your sister on eBay and now she's married? And I have a second sister who'll be online shortly.
Starting price L5.
This is what they do in Thailand, isn't it? That's fantastic.
And then slightly portly men in Barnsley buy them.
Yes.
Er, you must have met him.
Right, now, come on.
Your lap, how was it? It was great fun.
I don't think I damaged the car too much.
- Were you frightened? - No, I really enjoyed it.
You like speed, bearing in mind the bikes and skiing.
No, I really enjoy going fast, and it was a great fun day.
I really had fun.
Stig is great.
OK, now, who'd like to see the lap? - Yes.
- OK, let's play the tape.
Good bit of axel tramp, or whatever it is in a front-wheel drive car.
Come on, you little ! Enthusiasticl Up to the one hundreds.
Here's the yellow marker.
What yellow marker? You're seeing things.
That's good.
That's very good, very neat.
And very neat again.
He's very worriedl Are you all right in there? It's absolutely terrifying.
Did you look like that in the tank? No wonder you were first in.
Now, here we go now.
At the 50, no surrender! Right.
Good, that's very nice.
There's a huge great jet over there.
No, concentrate on the track, man, not the scenery.
Now, here we go.
That was very quick through there.
Second to last corner.
Are we going to get round that properly? Yes, cutting it nicely.
Into Gambon.
Here we go.
Wowl Nicely held.
Very good.
And there we are, across the line.
Yeah.
Here are the peeps who've been round so far in the Lacetti.
Any idea where you think you might have come, bearing in mind it was jolly wet out there? The only wet ones we've had, which are the ones to matter, are Jamie Oliver, and Philip Glennister did a wet one.
- Well, yeah, close to Jamie, if I'm lucky.
- OK, well, there you are.
So you did it in one minute 48.
3 seconds.
Ladies and gentlemen, a quick time for I'll put a wet on it.
A wet.
There he is, 48.
3 there.
So, are you pleased with that? You should be, 'cause that's a wet lap.
Yeah, just above Billie Piper.
Who wouldn't want to be there? - It's been an absolute pleasure having you.
- Thank you.
I do like Back To Bedlam, and I like the new album, so thanks very much.
- Ladies and gentlemen, James Blunt.
- Thank you.
Thanks, James Blunt.
That was a good time.
Now, it's fair to say that I'm not exactly a Formula One motor racing fan.
I was sitting in the office the other day, wondering why they're paid so much just for sitting down behind a steering wheel.
I may even have said out loud, "How hard can it be?" So someone decided it might be a good idea for me to go and find out.
This is the Renault R25.
As the car that won Fernando Alonso a World Championship, it's one of the all-time F1 greats.
The R25 is also the last of the breed from the monstrous V10 era, when the cars were chucking out close to a thousand horsepower.
There's going to be no Top Gear nonsense today.
I'm not going to race it against a cheetah or a bat on a superbike.
My mission is simply to get that round a track.
Specifically, two laps around Stowe Circuit at Silverstone.
More specifically, two laps without stuffing a priceless world-championship-winning F1 car.
Now, to put all this into context, the fastest road car I've ever driven is the Bugatti Veyron, which has a power-to-weight ratio of 530 horsepower per ton.
But the power-to-weight ratio of this is 1,500 horsepower per ton.
But it's not just the numbers.
Nothing can prepare your mind, your senses, your body, your reaction times for the assault of a Formula One car.
So, before the assault, it was back to school.
My teacher would be race team boss Jonathan Lewis, and my first lesson would be in one of his little Formula Renault cars.
- It's very simple, really.
- It looks like a Formula One car to me.
Only a bit smaller and not quite as fiddly.
OK, well, it is.
It is a baby Formula car.
As a Veyron veteran, I was keen to show him what I could do.
Still, the Formula Renault only has a piddly two-liter engine from a Clio, so mastering it should be easy.
Right, I'm going to try and gas it a bit down the straight.
Argh! Gah! I've never let a complete novice go out in one of our cars before.
The Formula Renault has only one fifth the power of a F1 car, and I now realized the size of the mountain I had to climb.
First time I've ever experienced what proper brakes are.
It just hits a wall! And just as I was getting used to this car, I was shoved into its bigger brother, a World Series car with twice the power of the Formula Renault.
Mother of God! He's gone quiet.
And no wonder.
The straight-line speed I could cope with, but in the corners I just couldn't think fast enough to react.
So quick! Come on, Hammond, just trust it.
It's just so There's so much to learn.
I can't drive fast enough to get the heat in the brakes, and then there's no brakes.
I've just grappled with 500 brake horsepower in a 500-kilo car, and I'm halfway there.
I was summoned to look at the readouts from my on-board telemetry.
You're riding the brake, and you're riding the accelerator, believe it or not.
'Cause I'm doing left-foot braking.
And you've been quite severe on one of the down-shifts, and you've put 8.
5 on the motor.
If I'd done what I did on that lap in a Formula One car, what would have happened? You'd have probably spun it and wrecked the engine.
What's an engine rebuild on a Formula One car? Probably about 150, 200,000.
More.
I needed lots more time in the World Series car.
But that wasn't going to happen because my muscles were struggling to cope with the cornering forces.
My head is going to come off, and I'm not joking.
His neck'll go soon, so he needs to drive the Formula One.
Before I moved on, Yoda gave me a pep talk.
Everything you experienced in the World Series car is probably going to be more than three times as much, maybe more, in the Formula One.
My thinking time, that was my problem.
You know, I had a bit of an off.
It's because I thought I'd left it too late to brake.
Then I realized I hadn't, but because I was thinking that, the car was already round the corner and I was in the wrong gear and I span.
I can't think fast enough, more than anything else.
You're going to have to really concentrate, Richard, especially with that thing.
If you think that's hard, that's going to be another level.
My fear wasn't just about the speed.
It was about what I was going to be entrusted with.
The more time you spend with one of these things, the more otherworldly it becomes.
Let's talk about the money, 'cause we can all understand that.
The engine, L170,000.
The gearbox casing, with no gears in it, L60,000.
The wing, L20,000.
But those are all the big bits.
It's still off this planet when you get to the little bits you've got on your car at home.
So the wheel nut, there it is.
500 quid.
And then for the socket to remove it, L1,000.
And look, the mirror.
It's just that little thing.
And the steering wheel, L30,000.
And it isn't just the money, either.
This thing is not just expensive, it's quite incredibly fragile and highly strung.
So the engine, the tolerances in here are so fine that when it's cold it's effectively seized solid.
You can't start it cold.
It has to be heated up.
They do that by constantly pumping warm water round it when it's in the pits, at 80 degrees.
You can't put cold oil in, either.
It has to be warm and fed intravenously.
It's like it's on a life-support machine.
That's snug.
If you're ten, I'm doing this on your behalf.
You're in here with me.
So now I've got control of the throttle.
That's me.
Dear God, that's me revving a Formula One engine.
The eyes of the whole F1 team were upon me.
This was it.
Revs.
It had taken me a minute to do 40 feet.
Why are we going? Are we going all the way back in? Is it all off? Here's the problem with this stalling.
I know it's very funny, but the car has a system.
If you stall in F1 it's a disaster, so as you're setting off, if it thinks you haven't got enough power it cuts the clutch in again, and you just look an idiot.
- Eight.
- Eight anti-stalls? That's a record, then, innit? After the team had laughed at me and warmed the tires to make them more grippy, they sent me on my way.
Oh, God.
It feels totally different to the other car.
Totally different.
Turning left.
My God, I'm in a Formula One car.
I'm going to try the throttle and see Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Holy Mother! There's no temperature in the brakes.
In the half a lap I'd managed, the car had made a big impression.
It's absolutely the most glorious machine in the world.
Wait till you get into second.
I'm going as fast as I feel I can, and it's not fast enough to keep heating the tires, which means I've got no grip, let alone no downforce.
If I go a bit faster than that, that means there'll still be no heat in the tires and no downforce, and I'm going even faster and I will crash.
The only way from where I am now is a lot faster.
Then I'll have heat in the tires and grip, and I won't crash.
And to make things worse, the man with my telemetry was hardly a bag of laughs.
There's a big gap between when you're lifting off and braking.
You should be coming straight off the accelerator and going straight onto the brakes.
There's no need to have that big gap.
When you say a big gap, how big a gap is it? - Half a second, between you lifting off - It's not massive, is it? before you go on the brakes.
It should be straight away.
He was right, though.
If I was going to do two laps in this thing, I had to dig deep.
I've got to think about everything I've learned.
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! That's unbelievable.
There's so much.
It's It's just going mental! There's no temperature in the brakes, they feel like they're not working.
Oh, this is like a dream.
I'd done a lap.
Just one more.
Turning in.
Oh, it's beautiful! I suspect the chief mechanic had seen better, but as far as I was concerned, driving Godl And the most scary thing in the whole world! The last corner is coming up! I'm braking.
We're turning left, I'm in second.
I'm going to nail it to the line.
God, I've done it! I've done it! I've done it! Whoo! To mark the occasion, the technicians let the engine play its party piece.
Yes! I did it! Yeah.
James, I happen to know No, no, really, I happen to know that after a while when you'd been in the Formula One car, they had to pull it in to reheat the tires, 'cause he was driving so slowly they were cooling down.
That did happen, but I experienced full throttle in a Formula One car.
Give him his due, he did use full throttle for 0.
2 seconds.
Er Anyway, it's now time to meet another guest, and this one can drive a Formula One car, even though he's only eight years old.
Ladies and gentlemen, Lewis Hamilton! Yes! Hey, how are you? - Good to see you.
- Great to see you.
Have a seat.
He's here.
He has come among us.
This is what I think you can call a friendly audience.
It is.
Thank you for the warm welcome.
- You don't have to worry - But it is cold in here.
- It is cold in here.
- I'm surprised.
- Couldn't you afford a heater? - No.
Because we have all the money.
Anyway, I want to start by offering - I guess all of us will do the same - big congratulations for an astonishing first year.
- Thank you very much.
- I have to start with that.
Genuinely amazing.
- Are you as amazed as we all are? - I am, absolutely.
Who would have thought? I'm just your average guy.
I just got an amazing opportunity to come to Formula One, and I managed to just lose the championship right at the end.
But it was an amazing year.
So when you arrived in Formula One, it was Australia, wasn't it, the first race, - are you expected to behave like a new boy? - Yeah, I think so.
I think for sure, everyone expects this is a new kid, he doesn't know what he's doing, and, you know, he's going to be a breeze to pass.
- That wasn't the case.
- It wasn't.
The first race, you overtook Eyebrow Man.
Alonso.
And the second one, you put one on Massa, didn't you? It was.
Massa and Kimi.
- Was Kimi drunk? - I don't know.
I should have asked him.
He was really on the left, this was Malaysia.
He was on the left and probably didn't imagine I would out-brake him up the inside.
Singing Sham 69 songs.
# We're going down the pub # Hurry up, Harry.
Come on, oi, oi! Who was that? That's that new boy that's gone past.
Erm We've just been watching Richard Hammond making a complete clot of himself in a Formula One car.
- Are these things hard to drive? - They are.
They're very, very hard.
When you're at high speed, doing 150, 180 miles an hour, and you're through a corner and you hit a bump, you try to correct it and the thing will shoot you off, so Are you fearless? 'Cause you've already said, "If you're going to die on a track, so be it," kind of attitude.
I don't think Well, I'm not looking to waste my life, but I've never had the problem of being scared.
You never, ever think, "What if a wheel comes off now?" - No, I've had that problem a couple of times.
- Well, quite! It is actually quite exciting when you're flying headfirst into a barrier.
The initial part.
The initial part is quite No, it is.
Especially when you hit the gravel trap and you get some air.
It's pretty cool.
But then you see it coming and you're like, "It's going to hurt.
" You do actually think it's going to hurt? I had a good one this year at the beginning of the season.
The team had worked very hard to get two brand-new cars out, and I shunted it at 180mph backwards into a wall.
I remember going over the gravel backwards, thinking, "This is gonna" and bracing myself, and I put my head back and it was actually quite a nice shunt.
Why don't you just watch Die Hard 4? That's exciting.
So, who do you want to be your teammate next year? Somebody useless, presumably.
- You want a job? - No, I can't fit in.
It'd be embarrassing.
That first race, you'd be like, "Oh, the fat bloke's gonna be useless," and history would repeat, I'd come flying past you.
- Yeah.
- Screaming.
But do you want someone Everybody presumably wants somebody crap? No.
Honestly, having someone this year that could push me all the way was wicked.
- And I learned so much from - Fernando? - He's a bloody good driver, I tell you.
- Yeah? I could have him.
I did once, on the Oxford ring road.
Honestly, he was doing, like, 80.
I came past, about 85.
No, 65 I was doing 70.
That hasn't worked, has it? No.
With your driving now Your dad's been very much a part of the build-up of your career, does he still tell you how to drive, like all dads do, if you're driving with him? Yeah, if we're on the road, he truly believes he's a better driver than me, and that if he had been given the opportunity, he would be in Formula One right now.
So what have you got, a Mercedes? Have you got one of those CLs? No.
You know what, I drive a GL500.
- Sorry, a GL420.
- Why didn't you get the 5? What? It's a diesel.
- It's It's a pimp wagon, you know.
- It's the fuel of Satan, man! You can fit 24-inch rims on it, and just lean back and drive, man.
That's all you need on the road.
What are you saying about yourself? Now, there's one thing that we've noticed.
Martin Brundle We've noticed that every time you don't do so well in a race, Brundle has talked to you.
- Talked to me.
- Have you noticed that? - I have.
- I think he's bitter.
- Yeah.
- I think he's undoing things on your car.
I believe that's what's going on.
Hit him.
No.
I mean Who'd win a fist fight, of all the British drivers? Erm Well, I used to do boxing.
I used to do karate as well, so - You're a black belt, aren't you? - Yeah.
I'm more into defending myself, so You wouldn't want to hit Coulthard, with that You'd break your wrist.
Probably break your hand, wouldn't you? - And I know Jenson doesn't like to - And there's stubble, as well.
And Oh, you know when you look at a Formula One car, obviously every gram that you can save, you save.
There is just no excess fat on it.
How come Jenson Button's allowed to have a beard? No, but seriously, 'cause that's got to weigh All the effort the designer makes and then he turns up with that face fungus.
I'd tell him to have a Well, you haven't started shaving yet, so you won't know.
- I've got a little bit growing.
- Really? Have you got pubes yet? It happens.
No, they grow.
It's ugly.
Erm, anyway, obviously, we now have to arrive at this point.
These are the Formula One people who have been here before.
Obviously, The Stig heads the board, with 1.
44.
4.
Mansell, Jenson Button, "Dill".
And then Mark Webber.
Mark Webber was the only one who came when it was wet, and I believe it's wet out there.
It's very slippery out there, and you said someone put oil on the track.
Was it Mark? Well, seriously, earlier today we had the Vauxhall VXR8 going round, which is Australian.
And the only person you're really racing is Mark Webber, who is Australian.
Now, I'm not suggesting he came down and undid the diff on the Vauxhall, but it was spewing oil all over the track, so you've got oil and water out there.
So, really, wet, that's the time you're aiming for, 1.
47.
1 I'm actually a bit nervous about this, 'cause I had some fun out there.
But I'm not here to compete.
Let's see what goes on.
- Yeah, right! - Honestly, I'm here to have fun.
- Who'd like to see the lap? - Yeah! Play the tape.
Wheel spin into second gear.
Come on.
Let's get going.
Now, let's have a look.
Were you using The Stig's line or No, that's where The Stig says it should go.
All the other F1 drivers go out wide.
That wasn't too bad.
I'd give it eight out of ten.
- Right, now, into Chicago.
- Oh, a bit sideways.
You're getting sideways on the way in, that was very nice, and super-tight round there.
- Now, what are you - Come on, man! Looks quite slow and tidy through there.
I was expecting more flamboyance.
Now, here we go.
Look at the grip, this thing will put Formula One cars to shame.
It won't.
It won't, it won't, it won't.
There we are across 0oh, you've gone for the slippery inside bit there.
And Are you taking this seriously? I've never seen anyone so lackadaisical about Whoa, that was lackadaisical but sideways.
Coming up to Gambon now, and that's pretty, pretty flamboyant.
And there we are! Across the line.
So - Quicker or slower? - What do you think? - Quicker! - Mark's a quick guy.
OK, you did it Not competitive! one minute And bearing in mind this is on a track covered in water and oil.
44.
7.
- No! Unbelievable.
There.
And that's wet and oily.
How did you do that? Seriously, I have to know.
I have to know, because everybody out there, including, I have to say, even The Stig, has to know, how did you do that? I don't know.
- Because he's done a 44.
4 - That's my time.
and, let's be honest, he knows this place like the back of his He hasn't got hands, but you know what I mean.
He knows this place extremely well.
You come down on a wet, oily track and do a 44.
7.
And you weren't even We saw you, whoo-whoo-whoo, singing.
- The car's good, you know.
- The car's crap, man! You know that.
Do you think you could go faster? Are you going to invite me back to do it on a dry day? I would absolutely love it if you'd come.
Everybody would.
- I'd love to.
- It's been such a pleasure.
I'm rooting for you next year.
I dare say everybody here is rooting for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, Lewis Hamilton! Amazing.
Astonishing.
And that, sadly, is all we've got time for.
We have to end the show.
Good night.
- No, no, no, there's more on car controls.
- Oh, God.
No, honestly, OK? Earlier on, we looked at the past and now it's time to look at the future.
Really? BMW called us up and they said they've built a car that doesn't need any controls at all.
- So how does it work? - Well, they say they'd bring it to our track and then they'd show it round, and then it would use really clever satnav to work out where it was, so it could remember all the coordinates.
- Really? - Yeah, exactly.
Really.
I mean, I had to go and have a look.
This is the most important car ever in the whole of automotive history.
Probably.
It's a four-door BMW330 saloon, and what I'm going to do now is take it for a spin.
BMW say that because this car has now learned our track, it can actually do a full-bore, smoking, pedal-to-the metal lap.
The only thing is, they say, "If you're going to do that, would you sit behind the wheel "just in case something goes wrong?" Hmm.
In case something goes wrong I can't believe I'm going to do this.
I can't believe it.
Right.
My foot is on the brake.
I'm now going to push this little button on the steering wheel, and it will set off at, erm, race speed.
Here we go.
Now Now, you see, that's uncanny.
It's revving up to 7,000rpm, changing gear.
It's turned right.
It's coming to the first corner.
Brake, please.
Brake, brake, brake! Brake! Brake! It It is! And I can't believe this! Coming up to the tires at 100kph, that's 62, as we brake to turn into Chicago.
As we steam towards the Hammerhead now, It has! There it is.
I'm not doing that.
My foot is still nowhere near the pedals.
It's turning in.
Imagine if the British had built this.
Ah, well, we didn't get it quite right.
We just missed that little bit out there.
Is it going to lift for the follow-through? We're now up to 130kph.
on an M3 if you really want to frighten yourself.
To death! Coming up to the tires, here we go.
120, 130.
This is 95 miles an hour through the tires.
Bang on! Please don't get it wrong.
Please don't get it wrong.
And it's just changed up to fourth.
Brake, brake, brake, brake, brake! Second to last corner! Come on, brake! Stig, you are sacked.
You are so sacked! It's unbelievable! Now Now, how do I stop it? Erm I forgot to ask the man how I stop it.
It's, erm I'm going to be out here for the rest of my life! How much petrol's it got in it? Three quarters of a tank.
I'm bored now!

<|endoftext|>

Tonight we take part in our first ever motor race James tests the new Fiat 500 near some youths on bicycles, and the Ascari A10.
Just how fast is this thing? Hello.
Hello and welcome.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Now, last year, you may remember, we borrowed some tractors and we planted 25 acres of oilseed rape.
The idea was that we were going to harvest it, and then turn the seeds into juicy, eco-friendly petrol, full of natural, dew-picked, farm-fresh goodness.
Unfortunately, James bought the wrong seeds.
We ended up with 500 gallons of and there's no other way of saying this diesel.
would have been more useful, honestly.
We hate diesel, so we decided to burn it.
Even though the three of us have no racing experience, we entered the Britcar 24-hour race at Silverstone with a diesel car.
All we needed was a car, so we got one, and then, while James was moonlighting on his wine program, Jeremy and I went down to the Top Gear Technology Centre.
Here it is, the crucible of all our great inventions.
This is the car we bought.
It's a BMW 330d, four years old, done 45,000 miles.
We paid eleven grand for it.
And now we must turn it into a racing car, by bolting lots of racing car bits to it.
The director of the Top Gear Technology Centre, Steve, would do all the trivial jobs, like the brakes, the engine, the suspension and the electronics, while we did the big stuff.
I had to do the race seat.
Jeremy, meanwhile, had to install a long-range fuel tank.
Got a hammer? With that not done, I checked on Hammond.
Yes! The office! That feels businesslike.
Hammond.
- What? - Do you understand endurance racing? - Yeah.
- 24-hour race, three drivers.
Do you want to hop out? So let's just say you do the first stint, here's the driver change.
You get out, the car's been refueled, it's my turn to get in.
Yeah, it will be a bit of a squeeze for you, I grant you.
It won't be a bit of a squeeze, mate.
It will be There you go.
You're in.
Vroom vroom vroom, all the other cars, those are the noises of them.
Meanwhile, back in the Top Gear pit, Jeremy You'd have to get a saw.
Well Yeah.
Right, I'll put the seat on runners, so it'll be more boring.
Next, we needed a drinks delivery system.
Most are rubbish, so I made ours battery powered.
OK, so when you want a drink, which you will, you put that in your mouth.
- Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
- I am squeezing it! Aha! Does that work? Well, it's not brilliant, if I'm honest.
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's flawed.
To make it look like a racing car, we needed sponsors' names.
But sadly, because of BBC rules we couldn't get real ones.
So we just sort of made some up.
Look at that! That looks like a racing car already.
- It looks like a racing car.
- It needed that, didn't it? With the car almost ready, our thoughts turned to the race itself.
You know I said, "How hard can it be?" When we started this? Yes.
If I'm honest, I think it's going to be really hard.
I'm quite glad you said that, cos it's crossed my mind.
I'm getting a bit nervous.
I don't want to win, but I want people to take us seriously.
I just think we're going to look ridiculous.
We arrived at Silverstone assuming the Britcar 24 would be an amateur event for beginners like us.
We were badly wrong.
In fact, our diesel Beemer would be up against 200 mph supercars.
The other drivers were chisel-jawed and battle-hardened.
They had blue chip sponsors, tonnes of equipment.
They'd turned up with laptops and luxury motorhomes with girls in them.
wasn't quite as professional as that.
And nor was our catering.
And nor was our car.
In fact, nothing was.
And then there was the question of us three.
You realize we are the only people in this field, the only people, with one of these on the back? I meant I did mean to ask, what is it? That means "novice".
Everybody else has done at least six races.
Worse still, Richard had never been round Silverstone.
The sum total of our experience is, you've done? I've done a charity race in a Honda Civic.
- And you've done five laps - Five laps in this.
And you've done no racing at all.
You've done some laps, but not in this.
I've done a race in a 2CV, I've never driven this and I've never, ever been round Silver We're not in good shape.
A walk down the pits didn't exactly cheer us up, either.
- We haven't got that.
- No, we haven't.
- We haven't got this.
- We haven't got that.
- We haven't got these.
- Is this a diesel? - No.
- What is it, an M3? - So this is an M3 BMW with a - It's a lot better than ours.
- Is it a diesel? - No, no.
It's a bit quicker than an M3.
- Please be nice to us.
- No.
How can we get out of it? I'm seriously thinking of sitting down before the race and drinking a bottle of vodka.
Soon, though, it was time for qualifying.
What if I have to get out of somebody's way to let them go by? I don't know.
I don't know.
This is, without any question or shadow of doubt, the scariest thing I've ever done.
- Yes.
- I've broken me zip.
That's bad? For qualifying, we had to do a minimum of three laps each, and the quickest time from our team would decide our place on the starting grid.
I went first.
Flat through Bridge.
Don't lift, don't lift, don't lift, don't lift.
I've got another M3 coming up behind me.
He's ruining my bloody lap.
What an absolute ! He ruined my lap.
The lap's gone.
Maybe Captain Slow would have better luck.
Oh, my God.
911s everywhere.
Don't be intimidated.
Just keep going.
May was back astonishingly quickly.
In fact, too quickly.
James, did you do three laps? - Two.
- Well, you haven't done a fast lap.
- I just did a fast lap.
- No, you can't do it in two.
- I'm sure I did.
- You didn't.
- All right.
- How could you not count? Hammond, meanwhile, had no idea where he was going.
This is Maggotts.
Or Becketts.
Or Vale.
Or Chapel.
We'd planned to leave Richard out there so he could learn the track, but now we had to get him in so James could go back out.
As cock-ups go, I've watched formula One since I was that high and I've never seen anybody - Forget to do a flying lap.
forget a flying lap.
Qualifying was turning into a shambles.
And when we tuned into the circuit TV, that went wrong, as well.
A chest of drawers and a table! We were a laughing stock, but we still had an ace up our sleeves our fourth driver.
Yeah, they weren't ready for thatl Can it do 24 hours straight? With The Stig at the wheel, we were in business.
- 2.
24.
- We're not bottom! Boston Bowl, let's go down there and mock! Sadly, we couldn't.
Because this was a 24-hour race, we also had to do three practice laps at night.
- My fear's come back badly.
- My fear's come back hideously.
It's looking at you that's making me more scared.
I went first, and it turned out my fears were justified.
People are trying to get round me, there's lights everywhere.
Jeez! I don't remember anything.
This really is all you can see.
You have to aim for corners and just sort of hope they're still there.
It's terrifying.
I've got nobody to follow.
Oh, God! Then it was Jeremy's turn.
Holy cow, I can't see a thing! He tried to cure the lack of visibility with speed.
I just took Bridge Corner flat, first time out.
Oh , I'm off! People behind must be thinking, "Who is this clown?" Amazingly, The Stig went faster at night than he had in the day, and put us in an astonishing 42nd on the grid.
- Yeah! - The great! Yeah! Don't touch him.
With James' qualifying in the bag, everything looked good for the race.
But then James, this is Richard.
What's happened? Tell us.
Throttle went mad, gearbox seemed to explode, everything.
Hang on, I'm coming in.
We now had a good starting spot on the grid but nothing to start with.
That's made a mess of them.
the clutch and the flywheel.
But we never quit.
Top Gear Technology Centre, innit? While Steve set about the car, we set about our high energy supper.
- I'm not worried that it's not going to be fixed.
- Perhaps he won't fix it.
The only worry I have is that if Steve has to work through the night tonight to fix it, when we do the race tomorrow, he has to work through tomorrow night.
- That's a three day - Yeah.
I'm not bothered about that either, now I think of it.
So to summarize, the car was broken, we were all rubbish, James' zip was stuck and we'd accidentally written "Arse Biscuits" on the driver's door.
Kind of par for the course with Top Gear.
We just expected the race to be the usual affair, everything would catch fire and we'd all drown.
We were quite looking forward to it, and then we went to visit the team that qualified last.
- To laugh at.
- Yeah.
But they told us that they qualified last the year before, as well.
But by being consistent and not making any mistakes, their Golf diesel finished 13th overall.
They'd beaten M3s, 911s and even the odd Viper.
Yeah, and this gave us an idea.
We thought, if we take this seriously, maybe our BMW diesel could finish in the top ten.
We'll see how that pans out later on.
But now it's time for the news, and there isn't any.
Even if there were, we haven't got time for it, because we've got a packed program.
So we must move on, to the 1950s.
James.
Over the past few years, many car manufacturers have been reinventing their old models from the past.
- Where you live.
- Thank you.
Volkswagen has given us the new Beetle.
BMW, of course, reinvented the Mini.
And now there's another one.
And here it is.
It's called the Fiat 500, and it's virtually a carbon copy of their legendary car from the '50s, which was called, erm the Fiat 500.
Now, the original car was small and ruthlessly simple.
You could even buy spares from your local newsagent's.
It was the last word in cheap utilitarian transport for the masses.
Now, let me say straight from the off, that this is not small, cheap, utilitarian transport for the masses.
Under this retro body, it's based on the current Fiat Panda.
I don't wish to get all bah humbug about it, but the Panda is bigger, it's more practical and it's about a grand cheaper.
So with your beige trousers on, that's the one you'd buy.
But the Panda is just a car, whereas this is a car and a fashion item.
And you'd have to say that on the style front, Fiat's done rather a good job.
I mean, everything in here wasn't on the original 500.
It's got automatic air conditioning and electric windows and buttons on the steering wheel.
But the feel of it, this pseudo-metal dash and these buttons and the big single instrument It even has a retro horn.
Prices start at L8,000, which means that although it is dearer than a Panda, it's a good three grand less than the cheapest Mini.
And although it's about six inches shorter than a Mini, it's actually more spacious inside.
But the thing about the Mini is that under its retro skin it drives brilliantly.
So the question now is, has Fiat pulled off the same trick? Well, its home turf will be the city, so we've brought it to one, Budapest in Hungary.
I've come here because a couple of years ago I raced some parkour jumpers through Liverpool in a Peugot 207, and lost.
And now some blokes have been in touch and said, "How do you fancy losing again?" The difference this time is that they're not big, tough parkour jumpers.
They're actually just scallywags on BMX bikes.
These wasters just ride around aimlessly, like those kids in the ET film.
So to borrow the phrase of the ancient philosopher Clarksonius, 4th century BC, how hard can it be? The race covers eight miles and starts in the old part of the city, Buda.
We go down the hill, across the bridge into Pest, on to the edge of the city and the giant industrial area, where we will finish in the biggest bicycle factory of the Soviet era.
Three, two, one, go! Now we're off.
I've lost sight of them already.
They're not going to last long doing that sort of thing.
the handling was classic Italian town car.
Quite a bit of body roll, but it's fine.
Just adds to the amusement value.
Leaving the old town, heading towards the bridge, and the BMX bandits were struggling to keep up.
Bloody hell.
But the bandits are made of stern stuff.
And on the snarled up bridge, I lost my lead.
But only for a moment.
Right, this is a crucial overtaking opportunity.
I know what I can do here.
Ha ha! Then we hit red lights, which I couldn't get round.
No! But they could.
Oh, come on.
Since I was losing, I got back to road testing.
You can have this car with 1.
2 or 1.
4 liter petrol engines, or you can have the engine I have here, which is the diesel, which is rubbish.
The whole point of a small Fiat is that you have a very small engine in it, powered by petrol.
You rev it and rev it and rev it until the valves come out and dance on top of the bonnet, and then you change gear.
I'd lost all sight of the bandits.
Yet again, they'd gone to ground.
Something I really like here is the rev counter in the speedometer.
One is inside the other, so the speed chases the revs up and down the dial.
It's terrific.
we enter the great Soviet industrial park, for the final stage in the race.
Bicycles Yaah! Oh, crikey! Come on, diesel! Where the hell are those people? There they are.
I can see 'em in the mirror.
But watch this.
If I'm very skillful here, I can box them in a bit.
There you are, parked on a lorry.
What? No! Dah! I can see the flag.
Oh, no, I can see them.
No! Oh, ! In Hungarian.
- You lost.
- Congratulations.
Well done.
Now go and get a proper bike.
- You get a proper car.
- Yeah, yeah.
Now, bad news.
Jeremy was summoned to the producer's office this week and told no more supercars on our test track for this series.
- Aaw! - I know.
He was most insistent.
He said we'd had too many and it was time Jeremy went and reviewed a proper family car.
So, here we go.
This is a Daihatsu Materia.
It's a small and easy to park five-door hatchback.
Now, what I thought I'd do is compare it to a rival, a competitor product of some sort.
The producer liked that idea very much, so what I've done is brought along this.
It's the Ascari A10, a carbon fiber powerhouse with a five-liter V8 from an old BMWM5 in the back.
I think it's better-looking than the Daihatsu.
And with 625 horsepower on tap, it's also much louder.
Quicker, too.
In fact, it's quicker than almost anything.
It is insanely fast.
Put your foot down and instantly you're somewhere else, very, very far away from where you were.
Naught to sixty takes 2.
8 seconds.
Flat out, you'll be doing 215 mph, and sign language for the rest of your life because you'll be deaf.
it was conceived by a Dutch billionaire and built on an industrial estate in Banbury, that it's all a bit half-cocked.
And sure, the interior is as luxurious and as well finished as an army Land Rover.
But the way this thing drives beggars belief.
It's funny, because it's not a heavy car, this.
It doesn't weigh much more than a family hatchback, but it feels like it's running on coal.
It feels like it's from the Industrial Revolution.
It feels like I should really be sitting here with a dirty face and a Davy lamp.
I just love this sequential gearbox.
It's as manly as Lawrence Dallaglio's jockstrap.
And then there's the steering, which is even better.
Because it's so good and so perfectly weighted you have the confidence to take this car by the wedding veg, and go absolutely berserk.
Whoa! It's a staggering car, this, like a Koenigsegg, only a million times more manageable.
But how does it compare to the Daihatsu Materia? Well, in a number of crucial areas, not well.
The Daihatsu has a CD autochanger, an airbag, five seats and a big boot.
The Ascari has none of these things.
You can't even understand the dashboard.
What's more, the Daihatsu is L339,000 cheaper than the A10, and much more economical.
And then there's the cornering.
It's a cold November day, but trust me, I'm sweating in here now.
No anti-lock brakes.
No traction control.
The only thing keeping this pointing in the right direction is me.
Whoops.
Now look at this.
Note how the Daihatsu gets round the same corner without crashing once.
And what's more, in a straight line at 85 miles an hour it'll easily overtake the Ascari when it's doing 70.
Choosing between these two, then, is not easy.
Certainly the Daihatsu is very good, but I think, on balance, I'd choose the big yellow shouty car instead.
- Ahem! - What? You were supposed to test a family car.
- I did.
- Yes, and look at this chart.
OK, the Daihatsu is considerably cheaper.
Its insurance group 8, not 20.
More doors, more seats.
Look at this, the Ascari, it doesn't even have inertia reel seat belts.
I hear what you say, but the Ascari is much faster.
And now we're going to find out exactly how fast, by handing it over to our tame racing driver.
Some say that he once lost a canoe on a beach in the northeast, and that he once did some time in a prison in Canterbury, because his teddy is called the Baby Jesus.
All we know is, he's called The Stig.
And he's off.
Nice clean start there.
But listen to that noisel It's like Victorian Manchester is trying to escape from the exhaust.
through there.
Looking remarkably tidy.
Mild drift, maybe, at the end.
cos the Ascari has no stereo.
Anyway, you wouldn't hear it over the sound of men in stovepipe hats furiously smelting.
Hammerhead.
This catches out some mid-engine cars.
But not this one.
Look at that.
Now, van Telford's supersonic steam train is offl Right, now, a chance to really open up that BMW engine.
Well, I say BMW.
Actually, it feels more like it was made by James Watt.
That is fastl This could be a seriously good time.
Just look how controlled it is through there.
Now, coming through Gambon.
Again, controlled.
And across the line.
Now Now because this has a hydraulic lifting nose, which we can see here, it is able to get over speed bumps.
And that means it is a road car, and that means it can go on our board.
But can it beat the Koenigsegg, which is a 1.
17.
6? Well, this did it in 1.
17.
3.
It's the new lap record holder, the fastest car ever to go round our track.
Now, earlier on, we entered a 24-hour race at Silverstone, and thanks to The Stig, we qualified 42nd out of 59 starters.
But there were a few problems.
We had no racing experience, I'd never even driven round Silverstone and we were using a secondhand diesel BMW that we'd turned into a racing car ourselves.
And at the end of the qualifying session, it was all badly broken.
Still, we were confident that it would be fixed and ready for the off.
So, race day.
The crowds were flocking in and we were summoned to the drivers' briefing.
supervised and then you will be released.
The Stig, however, found this a bit dreary.
on the way to the penalty box or leaving the penalty box.
Neither can you stop in the refueling area on your way to the penalty box.
If you need to go to your pit or you need to go and refuel Afterwards, there was a half hour shake-down session.
And we hoped that after a whole night in the workshop our car would be fixed, so Hammond could get out there and learn the track.
But it was not to be.
We've just discovered, having replaced the turbo, the inlet manifold, the clutch and the flywheel, all last night, that now there's diesel in the sump.
Which is what, a pump or the injectors? We don't know yet.
It turned out to be the fuel pump, which was a bit embarrassing for us three.
What they're saying is, our farm-fresh, morning dew diesel has got too much methanol in it, which is eating the fuel seals and fuel's getting out.
So, how long's it going to take to fix the fuel pump? In theory, to do the job in the workshop, it's a six hour job.
- So - Six hours takes us till We miss the race.
We've got some guys picking up some special tools.
We'll probably do it in two and a half.
- Well, where are they? - Milton Keynes.
- We haven't gone to pick them up? - There's a man on the way there now.
You're talking about it's impossible to have this car running until quarter past three.
- We have to be on the grid at five to four.
- Five to four.
- If we're not, we start from the pit lane.
- Yeah.
With two hours to go, the other teams were pretty much ready.
Us, however? Whatever you do, don't go downstairs and look at the car.
It's got no front end, no lights, no radiator, no bumper, no splitter, no front of the engine, no bonnet.
That fuel pump thing is right in the bowels of the thing.
They've got the whole front off.
It's like trying to repair something in France from this end of the Channel Tunnel.
James will be exaggerating James isn't exaggerating.
And it's leaking.
I watch Formula One a lot and I've never, in the whole time I've watched it, seen a Formula One car two hours before a race looking like that.
With an hour to go, finally, some good news.
Excellent! The fuel pump is on.
Watch this.
Ready? Pop it in, and away he goes.
- Now he'll have the engine fixed in no time.
- Easy now.
I don't want that back, thanks, Steve.
You keep it.
We were cheering up.
But honestly, our secondhand repmobile was beginning to look like classic Top Gear.
Ambitious, but rubbish.
And so it turned out to be.
Steve's team had done the fastest rebuild in history, but it wasn't fast enough.
As the other cars lined up on the grid, ours was still in the garage.
We missed it.
We never made it.
Now we'd have to start from the back, and if we couldn't get it started in 30 minutes, we wouldn't be starting at all.
With just 20 minutes to go, our super-green eco-car finally coughed into life.
Nobody's going to overtake us with this coming out the back.
But then It's only running on five cylinders.
Injector six isn't working.
It could be a simple fix.
It might be horrible.
- So, how long have we got? - Three minutes.
They're on their parade lap.
When they came back round again, the flag would drop and the race would start.
We had just over two minutes.
They're going to be back.
Stig's in.
Stig's getting in.
Stig's getting in.
The Stig had to be at the end of the pit lane before the last car crossed the line.
I have never felt tension like it.
Come on, come on, come on! They're past Stowe.
That's them.
- He's done it! - That's it, we're in the race! I cannot believe that.
- Bearing in mind, no test on that car at all - No.
it's out there now for 24 hours.
- Yep.
It looked a bit smoky, but it had The Stig at the wheel, and this is what he does best.
Type Rs, Porsches, M3s, despite his diesel engine, he had the lotl Have you seen his time? He's just done a 2.
17.
- No, I'm sorry, 2.
16! - Whoa! He's just taken another second off it.
Look how many people he's faster than already.
Every single one he's faster than.
Stig is now 13 seconds a lap quicker than the next diesel.
Having started in 59th place, we are now in 39th place.
- So he's made up 20 places in - One hour and twenty minutes.
But my worry now is that we're going too hard on it.
The Stig climbed another two places, but then James's negative waves hit home.
And hit hard.
That's not a good sign.
Did it fill with smoke? - Did it lose power? - You're wasting your breath.
It would help if we could talk to the driver and find out what actually happened.
But it's just stopped working, like a TV on standby.
We needed a tiny piece for the fuel injection system and, predictably, we didn't have it.
But mysteriously, ten minutes later, we didl This is it.
Somebody in the car park's going home on five cylinders.
The breakdown had cost us half an hour.
Because The Stig had got out of the car, the rules said he couldn't get back in again until someone else had had a go.
That meant he'd only done half his three-hour stint.
We've lost an hour and a half of Stig racing time.
Yeah, I agree, that's a shame.
But let's get on with it.
The Christian motorist was now in the hot seat.
Absolutely everything going past, but never mind.
- Really desperate for a wee now.
- Oh, man, I'm struggling.
I didn't know it would take you this long to get round.
Thank you.
Doing my best.
- Come on, that's what the Golf guys - You're a nice guy.
A few minutes later, though, something amazing happened.
I've overtaken someone! I don't want you to get all daft and giddy, OK? You just did a 2.
24.
I'm loving this.
Things were going well.
James wasn't quite as slow as expected, and unlike the petrol cars, which needed a five-minute fuel stop every hour, our tank would last three times that.
As night began to fall, the sheer effort required for endurance racing began to tell.
James was tired out, too.
His lap times were tumbling.
Normally, I'd be on the phone to him now, being fatuous and stupid, telling him he's Captain Slow and he's got to hurry up.
The last thing you want is anyone clowning around on your headphones, on your radio.
There's so much to think about.
You know, where's the corner? Where's the other car? What gear should I be in? When do I brake? I can't think about being a TV presenter.
the inevitable happened.
Bollocks! Sorry, I'm off.
Even though the car was good for another 90 minutes, we had to rest James.
How slippery are new tires? Bleeding awful.
Honestly.
Good luck, mate.
Please, God, don't let me mess this up.
My nerves calmed as I realized that Steve, builder's crack or not, knew what he was doing.
Steve, you've built one hell of a car here.
It's so utterly joyous and lovely to drive.
And it's already got a personality now, just having made the start and Whoa! God, we're good on the brakes! It didn't have much straight line speed, but through the corners it was astonishing.
I even went on the offensive.
I'm coming up behind those Italians in the 1 series.
Look at this.
Neck and No, he's come across my nose! We saved you from the Germans and that's what I get! Don't wreck the car.
As the night wore on, other cars were breaking down, but the little BMWpounded on.
Thanks, mate.
And when I finished my stint, we were up to 37th place.
What a truly fantastic way of spending an evening.
As my first ever racing lap of Silverstone would be in the dark, I couldn't say the same.
No, that's Maggotts and Becketts.
This is now opening down to Abbey.
No, to the bloody straight! Christ, you've got to concentrate.
Still, even Jeremy was encouraging.
Hammond, your speed is not only good but it's consistent now, mate.
Excellent.
I settled down for the night shift.
And then Bollocks! Guys, I've binned it.
Will it move under its own power? I'd say it was game over.
Steve and his magicians can't get this fixed.
I'm sorry, lads.
I'm I'm sorry.
Have you found out yet, did I take somebody else off? Could you find out? You did.
It was a white Mosler.
Oh, bloody hell.
I couldn't hit anything more expensive, could I? We've got to clear this .
Right, everyone who's not involved, get back.
The wishbone was broken, the disc brake was ruined.
Two wheels were smashed, the left headlight was shattered, the door was caved in and the engine wouldn't turn over.
If the boys can mend it, and if the scrutineer says the car is safe to go out again, you may use it again, so you're not out of the race yet.
As the car was being fixed we watched the onboard footage, to see how I'd managed to hit a half million pound Mosler that was fighting for the lead.
You thought there was only one car there, cos there was just a blur of light.
It goes through, you move over, there's someone else there.
It wasn't your fault.
I thought I hit the 944 doing exactly the same thing on the straight.
This is a shot I've just organized of Richard Hammond after the crash.
- Pan round.
- A portrait.
Cheers.
It took nearly three hours to get the car running again, by which time we were stone dead last.
The field was now spread out, but in the next three hours, The Stig climbed eight places.
Then, when it was my turn, the fog came.
I was completely blind.
Nora! Because the visibility had slowed James to a crawl, I thought I could get away with some fog-based japery.
James, it's Jeremy.
Whoo hurghl The bad news is, your joke's just had me straight off.
Eventually the fog became so thick, the race was halted.
And when it resumed, we were in the gray light of a summer dawn, when the drivers are all a bit dopey, as James demonstrated.
It would probably be rude to point out to him that he's pulled up in next door's pit.
- This is the wrong pit.
- Never mind, it's close enough.
Next door's pit was home to the Saxondale team, who were using a diesel BMW like ours.
After the calamities, they were now our main rivals.
As Jeremy geed up the capacity crowd Do a Mexican wave.
The Stig made mincemeat of them.
But then, 20 minutes later, disaster.
The front splitter, which helps with aerodynamics, had come off.
Oh, ! And there was a monumental fuel leak.
It was down on power.
He was five seconds a lap slow.
Then the splitter fell off that we put on.
- Yeah.
- Don't tell James.
Detachable.
They do that.
That's a feature.
The Stig stayed at the wheel, so after the leak was fixed, he could go out again.
And even though the missing splitter was ruining the handling, nothing was going to stop him.
Nothing.
Right now, at this very moment, computers tell us that Stig is having a wee in the car.
And I'm next.
This speeded The Stig up even more.
OK, it's now exactly 12 o'clock, as you can see.
Midday.
Four and a half hours left to run.
The Stig's work is done.
He's got us into third in class, we're the third fastest diesel, and now it's all up to Hammond, and then me.
It should feel OK.
The brakes have come off.
It's just sheared a bolt.
Nice! With the splitter coming off, the fuel leak and now this, it was clear our little Trojan was starting to fall apart.
It was also down on power, and with no front splitter, the handling wasn't great, either.
The car doesn't feel as fast as it felt last night.
Even I can tell something's wrong.
Ooh, that Aston Martin just span out in front of me.
And having been up for 30 hours, I nearly followed him.
Concentrate.
I'm losing my concentration.
Where Oh, bollocks.
To wake myself up, I organized a little present for Jeremy.
I'm having a pee right now.
Aah! At the end of Richard's stint we were still third in class, but I knew it would be hard to stay there.
The problem is that the Saxondale one, that silver 330, the one like ours, is 30 laps behind.
We're going to lose five laps at this next pit stop.
They've got their quick driver in there, against me.
I'm telling you, in three hours' driving, they're going to be right up my back bottom.
So, this was it, the final stint.
I was tired out, I was sitting in a puddle of wee, the car was sick, and we had our main rivals bearing down on us.
Please, car, please make it to the end of this race, I beg of you.
To stay in third, Jeremy had to drive fast.
But there was a problem with that.
Tires.
He's got to do two hours twenty minutes, yeah? I did that to these tires in two fifteen and they're absolutely trashed.
He's got to last two hours and twenty minutes on the same tires.
Jeremy, because there's no front splitter there's no down force at the front, and it's tearing the tires to bits.
So that we didn't need to waste time with another pit stop, Jeremy had to preserve his tires.
Unfortunately, though, this was Jeremy.
Yeah! Please don't be cross with me if that last lap was a bit quick.
If he's just done a 24, those will not last two hours, let alone two twenty.
Just to let you know, at your present pace you're going to be shredding those tires.
Sadly, he was too busy racing Team Saxondale to listen.
And I've got him! Took him on the inside at Stowe.
I mean Copse.
Jeremy, it's Richard.
I know you're busy.
Tell us about the tires.
Do they feel OK? I've got Saxondale up my trumpet.
I've got Oh, missed a gear! Whoa! God! Jeremy had destroyed the tires.
Just heard from Steve.
We have our tire expert in the pit lane.
He's looked at the other tires and says yours will last about another three minutes.
We had to get him in.
Saxondale would rack up five laps while our tires were changed.
But on fresh rubber, Jeremy could now get the hammer down.
Lap update.
Saxondale responding, 2.
24.
Get rubbing your rosaries, boys.
Whoa, God! I just tried to take the track on the inside of the corner and it went badly wrong.
If you fall off in the last half hour of the race, there's no recovery service.
That's the end of your race.
Happily, we got some luck.
The Saxondale team had hit problems, so now all I had to do was nurse the car home.
Come on, car.
Please make it.
This has been one of the best Top Gear companions of the lot, a repmobile, transformed in ten days into a racer.
Starting to get a bit sloppy now.
We're getting a few mistakes.
Five minutes to go and for the first time, and for the first time, I felt this pee-stained David among Goliaths was actually going to finish, and finish well.
It wants to make the finishing line.
I'm just willing it on.
It's there! Y-e-e-e-e-s! You brilliant little car! God, this is just brilliant.
It's absolutely epic.
